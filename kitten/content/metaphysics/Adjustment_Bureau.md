The [Adjustment Bureau]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Adjustment_Bureau.md" >}}) is a low-cost Metaphysics upgrade that serves as the gateway to the **Challenges** system in *Kittens Game*. Once purchased, it unlocks a dedicated **Challenges tab** (separate from the Science tab), where you can activate specific game-altering restrictions in exchange for permanent global rewards.

### **Costs and Unlocks**
*   **Cost:** 5 Paragon.
*   **Unlocks:** The **Challenges** menu and the secret **ASCOH** upgrade.
*   **Prerequisites:** You must first research the [Metaphysics]( {{< relref "techs/Metaphysics.md" >}}) technology (which requires 55,000 Science and 5 Unobtainium) to access the Metaphysics purchase menu.

### **How Challenges Work**
Challenges impose special handicaps that typically require a game reset to begin. When a challenge is active, [Chronospheres]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}) will not bring resources into the run (unless it is the Post-Apocalypse challenge); instead, those resources are placed in **reserves** and can be reclaimed once the challenge is complete.

*   **Rewards:** Completing a challenge for the first time grants both a **Base Reward** and an **Increasing Reward**. Multiple challenges can be active simultaneously, and rewards for repeated completions stack.
*   **Examples:** Common challenges include **Winter Has Come** (endless winter), **Anarchy** (lazy kittens), and **Atheism** (no faith bonus).

### **Strategic Advice**
*   **Timing:** Strategic guides suggest that you are generally not ready for the Adjustment Bureau and its challenges until you reach **Phase 2** (mid-game). It is usually better to prioritise price ratio reduction upgrades (like Golden Ratio or Renaissance) before attempting challenge runs.
*   **Iron Will Exception:** You do **not** need to purchase the Adjustment Bureau to play in **Iron Will** mode. Iron Will is a "hidden" challenge that is triggered simply by resetting and playing without building any kitten housing.

Are you planning to start your first challenge run soon, or are you still focused on accumulating Paragon for your initial Metaphysics upgrades?
