[Chronomancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Chronomancy.md" >}}) is a mid-game **Metaphysics upgrade** that serves as a vital bridge toward advanced temporal and astronomical technologies. It costs **25 Paragon** to purchase and is primarily used to increase the frequency of celestial phenomena.

### **Core Effects and Unlocks**
*   **Event Multiplier:** It provides a **1.1x multiplier** to the daily chance of both meteors and astronomical events. The sources explicitly note that this is a multiplicative bonus to the base chance, not a flat +10% addition.
*   **Technological Prerequisites:** Purchasing Chronomancy is required to unlock two essential high-tier Metaphysics:
    *   [Anachronomancy:]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Anachronomancy.md" >}}) Allows Time Crystals and Chronophysics to persist across game resets.
    *   **Astromancy:** Further doubles the chance of star events and increases the effectiveness of Observatories.

### **Strategic Utility**
The value of Chronomancy depends on your current stage of progression:
*   **The Starchart Solution:** In early runs where **Starchart production** is a bottleneck, the combination of Chronomancy and Astromancy is described as "pure magic". It more than doubles event frequency, allowing you to build a larger fleet of [Trade Ships]( {{< relref "craft/Trade_Ship.md" >}}) for Titanium acquisition.
*   **Late-Game Priority:** In very advanced "Endgame" or "Iron Will" runs, some strategies suggest prioritising price-ratio reductions (like Renaissance) first, treating Chronomancy as a "less vital" upgrade to be picked up once your economic foundation is stable.

### **Advanced Synergies**
The effectiveness of the Chronomancy bonus can be further amplified through late-game structures and upgrades:
*   **Temporal Accelerators:** These items in the Time tab improve Chronomancy’s time-related effects by **1.25%**.
*   [Blazars:]( {{< relref "transcendence/Blazar.md" >}}) As a Cryptotheology building, each Blazar improves Chronomancy effectiveness by **2.5%**.
*   **Observatory Integration:** Within the Bonfire tab, Chronomancy is listed as an upgrade for the [Observatory]( {{< relref "buildings/Observatory.md" >}}), specifically increasing the Astronomical Event Chance by the 1.1x multiplier.

Are you currently struggling to generate enough Starcharts for your space missions, or are you looking to unlock Anachronomancy to start saving your Time Crystals?
