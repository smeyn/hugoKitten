[Diplomacy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Diplomacy.md" >}}) is a low-cost entry-level Metaphysics upgrade that significantly accelerates your early-game trade and exploration by allowing you to discover other civilisations much sooner. It is widely considered one of the **essential first purchases** when you begin spending Paragon.

### **Core Effects and Costs**
The basic Diplomacy upgrade costs **5 Paragon** and provides the following immediate benefits:
*   **Earlier Discovery:** Civilisations can be discovered starting at **Year 1** instead of the default Year 5.
*   **Improved Relations:** Your starting standing ratio with discovered races is increased by 10, meaning they are less likely to be hostile.
*   **Hostility Mitigation:** It reduces the number of [Tradeposts]( {{< relref "buildings/Tradepost.md" >}}) required to negate Zebra hostility from 85 down to **58**.

### **The Diplomacy Metaphysics Tree**
Buying Diplomacy opens a progression path primarily focused on the specialised **Iron Will** mode and advanced navigation:

| Upgrade | Cost (Paragon) | Key Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Diplomacy.md" >}}) | 5 | Discover races at Year 1; +10 standing ratio. |
| **Zebra Diplomacy**| 35 | 10% of your Zebra cap stays when ending **Iron Will** mode. |
| **Zebra Covenant** | 75 | 50% of your Zebra cap stays when ending **Iron Will** mode. |
| **Navigation Diplomacy**| 300 | Allows civilisation discovery as soon as you have [Trade Ships]( {{< relref "craft/Trade_Ship.md" >}}). |

### **Strategic Advice**
*   **Priority Purchase:** Strategic guides recommend purchasing Diplomacy on your **second run**, alongside price-reduction upgrades like Golden Ratio.
*   **The "Zebra Trap":** While Diplomacy itself is vital, the subsequent upgrades (**Zebra Diplomacy** and **Zebra Covenant**) are often described as **traps for newer players**. Keeping a small number of Zebras when transitioning out of Iron Will mode provides very little benefit for the high Paragon cost.
*   **Starchart Synergy:** By discovering races earlier and mitigating hostility faster, you can build a **larger fleet of Trade Ships** more efficiently, which helps overcome the mid-game Titanium bottleneck.

If you are currently on your first or second run, focusing on [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Diplomacy.md" >}}) and the **price ratio reduction** upgrades (Enlightenment, Golden Ratio) will provide the most significant boost to your village's growth.
