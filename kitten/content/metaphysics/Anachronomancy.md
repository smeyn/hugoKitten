[Anachronomancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Anachronomancy.md" >}})  is a pivotal mid-game **Metaphysics upgrade** that allows your civilisation to preserve its most advanced temporal assets across resets. 

It is considered a mandatory requirement before a player begins focusing seriously on [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}) or deep-space exploration.

### **Costs and Prerequisites**
*   **Paragon Cost:** 125.
*   **Unlock Prerequisite:** You must first purchase the [Chronomancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Chronomancy.md" >}}) metaphysics upgrade.
*   **Technology Prerequisite:** You must have researched the [Metaphysics]( {{< relref "techs/Metaphysics.md" >}}) technology (which requires 5 unobtainium) to access the purchase menu.

### **Core Effects**
The primary function of Anachronomancy is to change the rules of what carries over when you reset your game:
*   **Time Crystal Preservation:** Your stockpile of [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}) is saved. Without this upgrade, all Time Crystals are lost upon reset.
*   **Chronophysics Persistence:** The **Chronophysics technology** is saved across resets. Once you have both Anachronomancy and have researched Chronophysics once, you will start every future run with that technology already researched.

### **Strategic Importance**
Anachronomancy is the gateway to the "Mid-Game" and the **Relic/Time Crystal economy**. 

1.  **Enabling Chronospheres:** Since Chronophysics is the prerequisite for building [Chronospheres]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}), having it available at the start of a run allows you to begin using temporal mechanics much earlier in your progression.
2.  **Unicorn Era Progression:** It is essential for the "Unicorn Era," where players sacrifice unicorns and alicorns to generate Time Crystals. Anachronomancy ensures that this effort isn't wasted when you decide to reset for more Paragon.
3.  **Efficiency Milestone:** Strategic guides typically suggest purchasing Anachronomancy after you have secured primary price-reduction upgrades like **Renaissance**. It allows you to "experiment with time crystals" without the risk of losing your investment.

### **Summary of Carry-Over Mechanics**
| Resource/Tech | Without Anachronomancy | With Anachronomancy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}) | Lost | **Saved** |
| [Chronophysics]( {{< relref "techs/Chronophysics.md" >}}) | Must be re-researched | **Saved/Auto-Researched** |
| **Temporal Flux** | Saved | Saved |
| **Chronosphere Resources** | Depends on CS count | Depends on CS count |
