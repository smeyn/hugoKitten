[Unicornmancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Unicornmancy.md" >}}) is a mid-to-late-game **Metaphysics upgrade** that increases the frequency of rare unicorn-related astronomical events. It is a critical component for players entering the "Unicorn Era", as it accelerates the acquisition of **Unicorns** and [Ivory]( {{< relref "resource/ivory.md" >}}), which are the foundational resources for generating [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}) and [Relics]( {{< relref "resource/relic.md" >}}).

### **Acquisition and Cost**
To access Unicornmancy, you must first research the [Metaphysics]( {{< relref "techs/Metaphysics.md" >}}) technology (requiring 5 Unobtainium) to unlock the Metaphysics purchase menu.
*   **Paragon Cost:** 125 Paragon.
*   **Strategic Timing:** Sources recommend purchasing Unicornmancy once you have secured your primary price-reduction upgrades (up to **Renaissance**) and are ready to begin serious progression into time manipulation.

### **Primary Effects**
The upgrade provides a **10% increase** to the daily chance of the following phenomena:
*   **Unicorn Rifts:** Random events enabled by [Ivory Towers]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Ivory_Tower.md" >}}) that grant a bulk amount of unicorns.
*   **Ivory Meteors:** Random events enabled by [Ivory Citadels]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Ivory_Citadel.md" >}}) that provide a burst of ivory.

### **Synergies and Scaling**
The benefits of Unicornmancy can be significantly amplified by late-game infrastructure:
*   [Blazars:]( {{< relref "transcendence/Blazar.md" >}}) Each level of this Cryptotheology building improves the effectiveness of Unicornmancy by **2.5%**.
*   **Ivory Infrastructure:** Because the frequency of Rifts and Ivory Meteors is fundamentally tied to the number of [Ivory Towers]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Ivory_Tower.md" >}}) and [Ivory Citadels]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Ivory_Citadel.md" >}}) you possess, Unicornmancy becomes exponentially more valuable as your religious infrastructure grows.
*   [Solar Revolution:]( {{< relref "religion/Solar_Revolution.md" >}}) While Unicornmancy increases the frequency of events, the [Solar Revolution]( {{< relref "religion/Solar_Revolution.md" >}}) bonus is one of the only multipliers that boosts the actual production of unicorn resources.

### **Strategic Importance**
In the late game, [Ivory]( {{< relref "resource/ivory.md" >}}) often becomes a major bottleneck because its production does not benefit from standard paragon or building bonuses. By increasing the frequency of **Ivory Meteors**, Unicornmancy provides a necessary "AFK" source of ivory. This allows you to build the vast numbers of [Ziggurats]( {{< relref "buildings/Ziggurat.md" >}}) required to refine **Unicorn Tears** and eventually trade with [Leviathans]( {{< relref "trade/Leviathans.md" >}}) for the resources needed to reach the "Infinity" stage of the game.
