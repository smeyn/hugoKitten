[Golden Ratio]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Golden_Ratio.md" >}}) is an early-to-mid-game **Metaphysics upgrade** that reduces the price ratio of buildings on the **Bonfire tab**. By slowing down how quickly construction costs increase, it allows you to build significantly more structures before hitting your resource caps, which directly boosts your production and maximum kitten population.

### **Acquisition and Prerequisites**
*   **Paragon Cost:** 50 Paragon.
*   **Prerequisite:** You must first purchase the [Enlightenment]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Enlightenment.md" >}}) metaphysics upgrade (5 Paragon).
*   **Unlocks:** Purchasing Golden Ratio is required to unlock **Divine Proportion** (100 Paragon).

### **Core Effects**
*   **Price Reduction:** It reduces all price ratios by approximately **1.618%**.
*   **Mathematical Basis:** The exact percentage reduction is derived from the mathematical golden ratio: $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$.
*   **Scope:** Note that this price ratio reduction only applies to buildings found in the **Bonfire tab**; it does not affect space structures or other categories.

### **Strategic Utility**
The Golden Ratio is considered a "price reduction meta" and is a cornerstone of efficient progression.
*   **Optimal Purchase Timing:** Strategic guides generally recommend purchasing Golden Ratio during your **second run**. 
*   **Kitten Threshold:** It is often advised to wait until you have accumulated between **155 and 160 kittens** before buying it. This timing allows you to benefit from the production and storage bonuses of your unspent Paragon for the majority of the run before spending the 50 points on the upgrade.
*   **Scaling Production:** Because it allows for more buildings (such as Huts and Log Houses), it facilitates a higher kitten population, which in turn leads to more **Paragon and Karma** upon your next reset.
*   **Late-Game Path:** In long-term or "Endgame" strategies, Golden Ratio is the first major step toward the **Renaissance** upgrade, which is the final and most powerful price-reduction tier.
