[Megalomania]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Megalomania.md" >}}) is a mid-game **Metaphysics upgrade** that serves as the essential gateway to advanced religious structures and the "Unicorn Era". It costs **10 Paragon** to purchase.

### **Unlocks and Benefits**
By purchasing Megalomania, you gain access to high-tier structures and mechanics that are otherwise hidden:
*   [Black Pyramids]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Black_Pyramid.md" >}}): These are necessary to attract [Leviathans]( {{< relref "trade/Leviathans.md" >}}), allowing you to trade Unobtainium for [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}) and [Relics]( {{< relref "resource/relic.md" >}}).
*   [Markers]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Marker.md" >}}): These strange structures initiate the **corruption** process, which slowly transforms Alicorns into **Necrocorns**.
*   **Black Codex**: Unlocks further religious upgrades, such as the [Unicorn Graveyard]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Unicorn_Graveyard.md" >}}), which boosts your maximum culture based on the number of Ziggurats you possess.

### **Acquisition Requirements**
To unlock Megalomania in the Metaphysics menu, you must meet the following criteria:
*   **Science Tech**: Research the [Metaphysics]( {{< relref "techs/Metaphysics.md" >}}) technology (55k Science and 5 Unobtainium).
*   **Metaphysics Prerequisite**: You must first purchase [Enlightenment]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Enlightenment.md" >}}) (formerly Engineering) for 5 Paragon.

### **Strategic Timing: When to Buy**
While its cost is relatively low, strategic guides offer specific warnings regarding when to invest your Paragon:
*   **The "Early Game Trap"**: Megalomania is often considered a **trap for new players**. Because the structures it unlocks (like Black Pyramids) are "really expensive" and belong to the endgame resource line, it is not recommended for your first few runs.
*   **Priority Order**: You should prioritise all **price ratio reduction** upgrades—specifically [Golden Ratio]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Golden_Ratio.md" >}}), **Divine Proportion**, and **Renaissance**—before buying Megalomania. 
*   **The 40k Run Exception**: If you are attempting a very long run (such as the **40k years** milestone), Megalomania is considered necessary to begin working toward Time Crystals as early as possible.

### **Role in the Unicorn Era**
Megalomania is the catalyst for transitioning from simple unicorn gathering to a full **Time Crystal engine**. Once purchased, you can refine **Unicorn Tears** into **Black Liquid Sorrow (BLS)**; five units of BLS allow you to build your first [Black Pyramid]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Black_Pyramid.md" >}}), which officially begins the process of trading with Leviathans for the temporal resources we discussed previously, such as [Anachronomancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Anachronomancy.md" >}}) and [Chronospheres]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}).

Are you currently preparing to build your first Black Pyramid, or are you still focusing on maximizing your population for more Paragon?
