[Numeromancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/numeromancy.md" >}}) is a late-game **Metaphysics upgrade** that grants your civilisation unique production bonuses during **Festivals** based on the current active **Cycle** of the Cath solar system. 

### **Key Statistics and Requirements**
*   **Cost:** 250 Paragon.
*   **Prerequisite:** **Numerology** (which costs 50 Paragon and applies cycle-based effects to space production).
*   **Unlocks:** The **Malkuth** metaphysics upgrade.

### **Festival Effects by Cycle**
When a Festival is active, Numeromancy applies the following multipliers depending on the current 5-year cycle:

| Cycle | Resource Bonus (x) | Primary Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Charon]( {{< relref "Cycles/Charon_Cycle.md" >}}) | 1.5x | Catnip, Wood, Minerals |
| [Umbra]( {{< relref "Cycles/Umbra_Cycle.md" >}}) | 1.5x | Coal, Iron, Titanium, Gold |
| [Yarn]( {{< relref "Cycles/Yarn_Cycle.md" >}}) | 2.0x | Culture |
| [Helios]( {{< relref "Cycles/Helios_Cycle.md" >}}) | 2.0x / 1.25x | Faith / Unicorns |
| [Cath]( {{< relref "Cycles/Cath_Cycle.md" >}}) | 2.0x | Catpower |
| [Redmoon]( {{< relref "Cycles/Redmoon_Cycle.md" >}}) | **2.0x** | [Unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}}) |
| [Dune]( {{< relref "Cycles/Dune_Cycle.md" >}}) | 2.0x | Uranium |
| [Piscine]( {{< relref "Cycles/Piscine_Cycle.md" >}}) | 2.0x | Science |
| [Terminus]( {{< relref "Cycles/Terminus_Cycle.md" >}}) | 2.0x | Oil |
| [Kairo]( {{< relref "Cycles/Kairo_Cycle.md" >}}) | 5.0x | Starcharts |

### **Strategic Synergies**
The most powerful application of Numeromancy is during the [Redmoon cycle]( {{< relref "Cycles/Redmoon_cycle.md" >}}) to resolve the [Unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}}) bottleneck. 

*   **The Redmoon Engine:** By running a festival during the Redmoon cycle, you receive a base **2x boost** to Unobtainium income. When combined with other endgame bonuses, this can reach nearly **2.5x total production**.
*   **Brewery Scaling:** Each [Brewery]( {{< relref "buildings/Brewery.md" >}}) you construct increases the "Festival Cycle Bonus" by **1%**. For example, having 50 breweries would increase the Redmoon festival bonus from 2.0x to 2.5x.
*   **Temporal Arbitrage:** Experienced players use a [Chronoforge]( {{< relref "upgrade/Chronoforge.md" >}}) to "shatter" Time Crystals, skipping less profitable years to land precisely on the Redmoon cycle and maximise the Numeromancy festival bonus.

### **Why It Matters**
Numeromancy is essential for the **mid-to-late game** transition (Phase 3 and 4). It transforms Festivals from simple happiness-boosting events into high-leverage tools for resource generation. This is particularly vital for reaching **Transcendence Tier 15**, as the faith income bonus in the [Helios cycle]( {{< relref "Cycles/Helios_Cycle.md" >}}) and the Unobtainium boost in [Redmoon]( {{< relref "planet/Redmoon.md" >}}) accelerate the accumulation of Time Crystals and Relics.
