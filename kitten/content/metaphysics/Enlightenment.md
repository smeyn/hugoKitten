[Enlightenment]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Enlightenment.md" >}}) is an entry-level Metaphysics upgrade that provides a permanent global reduction in building costs on the **Bonfire tab**., It is considered a foundational purchase because it slows the rate at which building prices increase, allowing you to build more structures before hitting resource caps.

### **Costs and Unlocks**
*   **Cost:** 5 Paragon.
*   **Unlocks:** Purchasing Enlightenment is a prerequisite for several critical branches of the Metaphysics tree:
    *   **Price Reduction:** Unlocks [Golden Ratio]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Golden_Ratio.md" >}}).
    *   **Religious/Unicorn Mechanics:** Unlocks [Megalomania]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Megalomania.md" >}}).,
    *   **Crafting:** Unlocks **Codex Vox**.

### **Core Effects**
*   **Price Ratio Reduction:** It reduces all building price ratios by **1%**.
*   **Persistent Bonus:** Like all Metaphysics upgrades, Enlightenment is permanent and **carries over through game resets**, though the "Metaphysics" technology itself must be re-researched in each new run to access the menu.,

### **Strategic Timing**
Strategic guides emphasize that Enlightenment is one of the **essential first purchases** when you begin spending your Paragon:
*   **Second Run Priority:** It is highly recommended to buy Enlightenment on your **second run**, typically alongside [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Diplomacy.md" >}}).,
*   **Early-Game Milestone:** You should aim to have enough kittens (130+) on your first reset to gain roughly 60 Paragon, which is more than enough to afford Enlightenment and its immediate follow-ups.
*   **Foundational Step:** It serves as the starting point for the "price reduction meta," eventually leading to powerful late-game upgrades like **Renaissance**.,

**Note:** In older versions of the game, this upgrade was named [Engineering]( {{< relref "techs/Engineering.md" >}}).
