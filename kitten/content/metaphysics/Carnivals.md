 a mid-game Metaphysics upgrade that allows festivals to stack in duration, though there is also a similarly named Carnivale policy that modifies festival effects.
Metaphysics: Carnivals
The Carnivals upgrade is an essential step in the temporal and religious Metaphysics tree.
• Cost: 25 Paragon.
• Primary Effect: It allows your Festivals to stack in duration. Without this, clicking "Hold a Festival" while one is already active simply wastes resources; with Carnivals, the time is added to the remaining duration.
• Progression: It is the direct prerequisite for Numerology. It is also considered a mandatory part of the path to Order of the Void and reaching high Transcendence Tiers in the late game.
