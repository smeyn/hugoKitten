**Burning paragon** is a mechanic that converts your standard unspent paragon into "burned" paragon. While burned paragon is less effective than regular paragon for production in the early game, it provides unique stacking bonuses and becomes significantly more powerful during the late-game "Dark Future" period.

### **Core Effects of Burned Paragon**

*   **Production Bonus:** Burned paragon has approximately half the production effectiveness of regular paragon. However, it **stacks with regular paragon**, allowing you to bypass the diminishing returns that standard paragon faces after the 150–200 point threshold.
*   **Storage Capacity:** 
    *   **Before Dark Future (Year 40,000):** Each burned paragon provides a **0.05%** storage capacity bonus (half of regular paragon’s 0.1%).
    *   **During Dark Future:** Each burned paragon provides a **0.2%** storage capacity bonus, making it twice as effective as regular paragon for increasing resource caps.
*   **Leader Trait Bonus:** Having burned paragon provides a slight boost to the effects of your **kitten leader’s traits** (such as Scientist, Artisan, or Manager).
*   **Persistence:** Like regular paragon, burned paragon is a permanent resource that **carries over** through all resets.

### **Strategic Timing: When to Burn**

Deciding when to burn your stash depends on your current progression:

*   **The 400-Point Threshold:** A common strategy is to consider burning paragon once you reach **400 unspent points**. At this stage, 400 burned paragon provides roughly the same production boost as 200 regular paragon, but because it stacks, it helps push production higher as standard paragon gains become marginal.
*   **Storage Caps:** Because burned paragon storage bonuses never diminish, they are essential in the late game for reaching the massive **unobtainium caps** (e.g., 8.14 billion) required for self-sustaining resets with 100 Chronospheres.
*   **Preparation for Iron Will:** For players attempting the **"Insane" Space Oddity** achievement, you must have **less than 10 unburned paragon** in your bank. Burning your paragon allows you to keep the production and storage benefits of your prestige without disqualifying yourself from the achievement.

### **Important Considerations**

*   **Wait for Metaphysics:** It is generally recommended to prioritize purchasing **price ratio reduction Metaphysics** (like Golden Ratio, Divine Proportion, and Renaissance) before burning paragon.
*   **Dark Future Milestone:** Since the storage bonus quadruples during the Dark Future, burning paragon is a primary strategy for players planning "Endless Runs" or deep-space exploration.
*   **Gold Star Space Oddity:** Obtaining the **Space Oddity gold star** reward provides a permanent benefit: it allows you to burn paragon in the future **without exiting Iron Will mode**.
