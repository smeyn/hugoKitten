+++
The [Redmoon cycle]( {{< relref "Cycles/Redmoon_cycle.md" >}}) is the sixth phase in the ten-cycle system of *Kittens Game* and is widely considered the most strategically important period for late-game resource farming. Its primary purpose is to provide a massive multiplier to **Unobtainium production**, which is the critical bottleneck for space exploration and time manipulation.

### **Core Effects**
The impact of the Redmoon cycle depends on your researched [Metaphysics]( {{< relref "techs/Metaphysics.md" >}}) upgrades:

| Upgrade Required | Effect during Redmoon |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Numerology** | **+20% Unobtainium output** from Lunar Outposts. |
| **Numerology** | **-50% Gigaflop consumption** for Entanglement Stations. |
| [Numeromancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/numeromancy.md" >}}) | Holding a festival provides an additional **x2 Unobtainium income**. |

### **The "Shatter into Redmoon" Strategy**
Because the Redmoon cycle is so much more productive than other cycles, endgame players use [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}) to skip less profitable years and land exactly on the Redmoon phase.

*   **Timing:** The first Redmoon cycle begins at **Year 25** and lasts for five years (approximately 66.67 minutes of real-time play).
*   **The Shatter Engine:** By "shattering" (combusting) Time Crystals in the [Chronoforge]( {{< relref "upgrade/Chronoforge.md" >}}), players can advance the calendar instantly. It takes **45 skips** to get from the end of one Redmoon cycle back to the start of the next one.
*   **Maximising Returns:** Strategic guides recommend staying in Redmoon as much as possible to fuel the "Type 0 Relic Engine". When combined with **Breweries**, the festival bonus in Redmoon can reach nearly **2.5x total production**.

### **Why It Matters for Progression**
The Redmoon cycle is the foundation of the **self-sustaining positive chrono-reset loop**. 
*   **Unobtainium Accumulation:** Players need billions of Unobtainium to build the 70+ [Chronospheres]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}) required to carry over enough resources to make a reset profitable. 
*   [Arbitrage:]( {{< relref "guides/arbitrage.md" >}}) By timing their most intensive production and trading (specifically with the **Elders/Leviathans**) during Redmoon, players can generate the massive amounts of Unobtainium and Time Crystals needed to reach the **Endgame**.
