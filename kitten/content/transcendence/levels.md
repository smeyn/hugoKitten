Uranium, a critical resource in the later stages of the game, is primarily acquired through three methods: trading with the Dragons, production via upgraded Quarries, and refinement using Accelerators.

Here is a breakdown of what produces or provides Uranium:

### 1. Production via Buildings and Upgrades

Uranium can be produced directly using advanced buildings and upgrades:

*   [Quarry]( {{< relref "buildings/Quarry.md" >}}) (with [Orbital Geodesy]( {{< relref "upgrade/Orbital_Geodesy.md" >}})): Quarries will provide a small amount of uranium once the [Orbital Geodesy]( {{< relref "orbital_geodesy.md" >}}) upgrade is purchased [1, 2]. Quarries produce uranium at a rate of **0.0005 per tick** [2].
    *   [Orbital Geodesy]( {{< relref "orbital_geodesy.md" >}}) requires [Satellites]( {{< relref "satellites.md" >}}) technology and costs 150,000 Science, 1,000 Alloy, and 35,000 Oil [2].
*   [Accelerator:]( {{< relref "accelerator.md" >}}) This building refines **titanium into uranium** [1]. Accelerators produce **0.0025 uranium per tick** (or 0.0125 per second) [3, 4].
    *   The Accelerator building is unlocked by researching the [Particle Physics]( {{< relref "particle_physics.md" >}}) science [3, 5]. It costs 7,500 Titanium, 125 Concrete, and 25 Uranium [3].
*   [Planet Cracker:]( {{< relref "space/planet_cracker.md" >}}) Uranium is produced by the [Planet Cracker]( {{< relref "space/planet_cracker.md" >}}) structure [1, 6]. This structure's output is affected by the [Dune]( {{< relref "dune.md" >}}) cycle, which can increase its uranium output by **+10%** [7].
*   **Reactor (Consumption Reduction):** While Reactors consume Uranium [8], the [Enriched Uranium]( {{< relref "enriched_uranium.md" >}}) upgrade reduces this consumption by **25%** and also provides a **+25% uranium production bonus** that applies only to Quarries [9].

### 2. Acquisition via Trade

The most straightforward way to initially acquire Uranium is through trade:

*   [Dragons:]( {{< relref "trade/Dragons.md" >}}) Uranium can be **bought** from the [Dragons]( {{< relref "trade/Dragons.md" >}}) civilization, in exchange for Titanium [1].
    *   Dragons sell **1 Uranium** and the trade has a 95% chance of success (reaching 100% chance with 6 Embassy levels) [10, 11].
    *   Dragons are unlocked after researching [Nuclear Fission]( {{< relref "nuclear_fission.md" >}}) [12].

### 3. Production Boosts

Uranium production can be boosted by:

*   **Cycles (Dune):** The [Dune]( {{< relref "dune.md" >}}) cycle doubles Uranium income when the **Numerology** metaphysics upgrade is researched [7].
*   [Enriched Uranium:]( {{< relref "enriched_uranium.md" >}}) This Workshop upgrade increases Uranium production by **+25%** (but only applies to Quarries) [9].
*   [Planet Busters:]( {{< relref "planet_busters.md" >}}) This upgrade doubles the output of the Planet Cracker structure [13].

Uranium is an important resource, particularly in the later stages of the game, as it is needed to refine [Unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}}) via a Lunar Outpost [1, 4].
