The [Pumpjack]( {{< relref "upgrade/Pumpjack.md" >}}) is a crucial mid-game Workshop upgrade in *Kittens Game* that enhances the efficiency of [Oil Wells]( {{< relref "buildings/Oil_Well.md" >}}) while introducing a modest energy requirement.

### Key Details and Effects

| Category | Specification | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | Workshop Upgrade for Oil Wells |, |
| **Prerequisite Technology** | [Mechanization]( {{< relref "techs/Mechanization.md" >}}) |, |
| **Cost** | 100,000 Science, 250 Titanium, and 125 Gear | |
| **Effect** | Improves Oil Well effectiveness by **+45%** (additive with other effects like Oil Refinery and Oil Distillation) |, |
| [Energy]( {{< relref "resource/energy.md" >}}) | Oil Wells will now consume **1 Watt (Wt) Energy** each |, |
| **Functionality** | It enables automation, allowing you to activate or deactivate individual Oil Wells. | |

### Strategic Context

The Pumpjack is essential for accelerating oil production, which is a key bottleneck resource for several subsequent upgrades and buildings, including [Kerosene]( {{< relref "resource/kerosene.md" >}}) production (rocket fuel),, and space missions such as the Moon Mission.

*   **Production Boost:** The $+45\%$ boost to oil output significantly increases your supply, especially when combined with other oil production upgrades like [Oil Refinery]( {{< relref "upgrade/Oil_Refinery.md" >}}) and [Oil Distillation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Oil_Distillation.md" >}}).
*   **Energy Management:** While it boosts production, the upgrade introduces a base energy cost (1 Wt) to Oil Wells. This reinforces the need for stable energy infrastructure, achieved through buildings like [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}) and [Magnetos]( {{< relref "buildings/Magneto.md" >}}) or renewable upgrades like [Solar Farms]( {{< relref "buildings/Solar_Farm.md" >}}) and [Hydro Plants]( {{< relref "buildings/Hydro_Plant.md" >}}).

To achieve the necessary technological prerequisite, Pumpjack requires researching [Mechanization]( {{< relref "techs/Mechanization.md" >}}),, which itself is unlocked via the [Industrialization]( {{< relref "techs/Industrialization.md" >}}) technology path,.

You can think of the Pumpjack as standardising and improving the oil extraction process: it makes your Oil Wells yield significantly more resource, but requires electricity to run the machinery.
