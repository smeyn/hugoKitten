[Refrigeration]( {{< relref "upgrade/Refrigeration.md" >}}) is a mid-to-late-game **workshop upgrade** that significantly enhances your colony's ability to stockpile food by increasing the **global catnip storage capacity by 75%**. This upgrade is unlocked by researching the [Electronics]( {{< relref "techs/Electronics.md" >}}) technology.

### **Cost and Requirements**
To purchase Refrigeration, you must invest the following resources:
*   **125,000 Science**
*   **2,500 Titanium**
*   **15 Blueprints**

### **Mechanical Effects and Scaling**
The primary function of Refrigeration is to apply a **percentage-based multiplier** to your total catnip capacity provided by all storage structures, such as Barns, Warehouses, and Harbours. 
*   **Additive Synergy:** This bonus is **additive** with the bonuses provided by [Hydroponics]( {{< relref "techs/Hydroponics.md" >}}). For example, if you have researched Refrigeration (+75%) and constructed 50 Hydroponics (+10% each for a total of +500%), your total global catnip storage bonus would be **+575%**.
*   **Storage Formula:** The final capacity for catnip is calculated by taking the base storage of your buildings and multiplying it by several factors, including building upgrades (like Expanded Barns), the global catnip storage bonus (Refrigeration and Hydroponics), and global storage multipliers from [Paragon]( {{< relref "resource/paragon.md" >}}) or **Void Rifts**.

### **Strategic Utility**
While early-game survival depends on managing production through [Farmers]( {{< relref "job/Farmer.md" >}}) and [Aqueducts]( {{< relref "buildings/Aqueduct.md" >}}) to survive "Cold" winters, Refrigeration becomes available during the **Industrial and Space eras**. At this stage of development, increasing the catnip "cap" is less about immediate survival and more about **resource efficiency**. 
*   **Preventing Waste:** Initially, any catnip produced beyond the 5,000-unit starting limit is lost. Expanding this cap allows for a larger buffer during long idle periods or when shifting the workforce entirely into non-food roles like [Scholars]( {{< relref "job/Scholar.md" >}}) or [Geologists]( {{< relref "job/Geologist.md" >}}).
*   **Refinement Efficiency:** Increasing the cap allows players to hold more catnip for mass-conversion into **Wood** via the "Refine catnip" button, which becomes more efficient after the [Catnip Enrichment]( {{< relref "upgrade/Catnip_Enrichment.md" >}}) upgrade.

Think of Refrigeration like upgrading your colony from a standard esky to a professional **walk-in freezer**; it doesn't make the catnip grow faster, but it ensures that when your fields are overflowing, you have the room to keep every last leaf fresh for when the winter nosedive hits.
