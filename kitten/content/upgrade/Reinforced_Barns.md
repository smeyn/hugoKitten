The **Reinforced Barns** upgrade is a critical early-to-mid-game investment in the Workshop tab, designed to alleviate constraints on your resource capacity.

### Function and Effects

The primary function of Reinforced Barns is to expand the maximum storage limits of core resources provided by your general storage buildings.

*   **Storage Increase:** The upgrade provides **80% more storage space** for the affected resources.
*   **Buildings and Resources Affected:** This 80% bonus is applied to the maximum storage capacity for **wood, minerals, and iron** provided by **Barns, Warehouses, and Harbors**.

This increase is vital because resource storage limits are a major bottleneck that can slow progress significantly.

### Cost and Progression

Reinforced Barns is an upgrade that improves upon the base storage capacity established by the Barn, which is unlocked after researching Agriculture.

*   **Cost:** The upgrade costs **800 Science**, **25 Beam**, **10 Slab**, and **100 Iron**.

It is part of a progression of storage capacity upgrades for Barns, and is a prerequisite for more advanced upgrades:

| Upgrade | Effect on Max Storage (Wood, Minerals, Iron) | Predecessor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Expanded Barns** | +75% increase | N/A |
| **Reinforced Barns** | +80% increase | N/A (listed as having no prerequisite in the table) |
| **Titanium Barns** | +100% increase (twice as many resources) | Requires Reinforced Barns |

Additionally, once the **Silos** upgrade is purchased, all storage upgrades containing "barns" in their name, including Reinforced Barns, apply **25% of their effect to maximum Catnip storage** as well.
