In *Kittens Game*, [Geodesy]( {{< relref "upgrade/Geodesy.md" >}}) refers to two specific Workshop upgrades that are essential for automating the production of [gold]( {{< relref "resource/Gold.md" >}}) and [uranium]( {{< relref "resource/uranium.md" >}}).

### **Geodesy (Workshop Upgrade)**
*   **Requirements:** Unlocked via the [Geology]( {{< relref "techs/Geology.md" >}}) technology. It costs **90,000 Science**, **250 Titanium**, and **500 Starcharts**.
*   **Mechanics:** This upgrade enables kittens assigned to the [Geologist]( {{< relref "job/Geologist.md" >}}) job to produce [gold]( {{< relref "resource/Gold.md" >}}) (+0.0008 per tick) and increases their [coal]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}) production (+0.0075 per tick).
*   **Strategic Importance:** It is a critical mid-game upgrade used to resolve **gold bottlenecks**. Gold is required for trading with other civilisations, building Temples, and purchasing Tradeposts. Once Geodesy is active, players often move most kittens to the Geologist job to power a high-volume **trade engine**, which becomes the primary source of iron and titanium in the mid-to-late game.

### **Orbital Geodesy (Workshop Upgrade)**
*   **Requirements:** Unlocked via the [Satellites]( {{< relref "techs/Satellites.md" >}}) technology. It costs **150,000 Science**, **1,000 Alloy**, and **35,000 Oil**.
*   **Mechanics:** This upgrade allows **Quarries** to passively produce [uranium]( {{< relref "resource/uranium.md" >}}) at a rate of 0.0005 per tick.
*   **Strategic Importance:** Orbital Geodesy is foundational for the transition into the space era. It allows for the accumulation of uranium without the need to trade titanium to Dragons, which is vital for maintaining the **uranium supply** required to run [Lunar Outposts]( {{< relref "planet/lunar_outpost.md" >}}). It is considered highly beneficial when pushing toward [Unobtainium Huts]( {{< relref "upgrade/Unobtainium_Huts.md" >}}), as it simplifies the management of the resources needed for Moon Bases.

### **Comparison of Geodesy Upgrades**

| Feature | Geodesy | Orbital Geodesy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prerequisite Tech** | Geology | Satellites |
| **Primary Resource** | [Gold]( {{< relref "resource/Gold.md" >}}) | [Uranium]( {{< relref "resource/uranium.md" >}}) |
| **Affected Unit** | Geologist (Kitten Job) | Quarry (Building) |
| **Science Cost** | 90,000 | 150,000 |
| **Primary Utility** | Scaling trade and religion | Passive fuel for space missions |

While [Geodesy]( {{< relref "upgrade/Geodesy.md" >}}) focuses on kitten-based labour to drive the economy through trade and cultural expansion, [Orbital Geodesy]( {{< relref "upgrade/Orbital_Geodesy.md" >}}) focuses on industrial automation to provide the radioactive materials necessary for advanced space travel and unobtainium production.
