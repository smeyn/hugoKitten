[Steel Plants]( {{< relref "upgrade/Steel_Plants.md" >}}) is a mid-to-late-game workshop upgrade that automates the production of [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) through [Calciners]( {{< relref "buildings/Calciner.md" >}})., This upgrade is essential for scaling infrastructure without relying solely on manual crafting or the trade loop with Griffins.,,

### **Unlocking and Costs**
To access Steel Plants, you must first research the [Robotics]( {{< relref "techs/Robotics.md" >}}) technology, which itself requires [Electronics]( {{< relref "techs/Electronics.md" >}})., The upgrade costs the following resources:
*   **140,000 Science**
*   **3,500 Titanium**
*   **750 Gears**

### **Mechanical Effects**
Once purchased, Steel Plants modify the output of every active [Calciner]( {{< relref "buildings/Calciner.md" >}})., The upgrade reserves **10% of the iron** produced by Calciners and automatically converts it into Steel at a **100:1 ratio**., It also results in a reduction of [Coal production]( {{< relref "resource/coal_production.md" >}}) equivalent to 10% of the iron output. This provides a consistent, passive income of Steel that functions independently of your kitten workforce.,

### **Synergistic Enhancements**
The effectiveness of Steel Plants can be significantly improved through subsequent workshop upgrades and policy choices:
*   [Automated Plants:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Automated_Plants.md" >}}) This follow-up upgrade increases the amount of Steel produced by **25% of your general craft ratio** without increasing iron or coal consumption.,
*   [Nuclear Plants:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Nuclear_Plants.md" >}}) Unlocked after Automated Plants, this upgrade further boosts Steel production by **2% for every active Reactor** you have built.,
*   **Griffin Relations (Metallurgists):** Choosing this policy provides a flat **15% bonus** to the Steel production of Calciners.,

### **Strategic Utility**
Steel is a critical craftable resource required for high-tier buildings like [Oil Wells]( {{< relref "buildings/Oil_Well.md" >}}), [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}), and **Data Centres**, as well as advanced alloys like [Eludium]( {{< relref "resource/eludium.md" >}}).,,, In the "Concrete Era" and beyond, the demand for Steel grows exponentially., While early-game Steel is typically managed through manual crafting or [Coal Furnaces]( {{< relref "upgrade/Coal_Furnace.md" >}}) in Smelters, Steel Plants allow Calciners to become your primary industrial engine, especially when paired with [Oxidation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Oxidation.md" >}}) to boost iron throughput.,, This automation is particularly valuable during long idles or when [Coal]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}) production is slow.,
