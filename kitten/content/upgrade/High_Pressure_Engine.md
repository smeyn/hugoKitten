The [High Pressure Engine]( {{< relref "upgrade/High_Pressure_Engine.md" >}}) is a Workshop upgrade available in *Kittens Game*.

Here are the details regarding the upgrade:

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** This upgrade is unlocked by researching the [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Cost:** To purchase the High Pressure Engine, you need **20,000 Science**, **25 Gears**, and **5 Blueprints**.
*   **Effect:** The purpose of the High Pressure Engine is to **reduce the coal consumption of Steamworks by 20%**.
*   **Building Context:** It is one of the upgrades associated with the [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}) building, which itself is unlocked by the [Machinery]( {{< relref "science/machinery.md" >}}) technology.

This upgrade is crucial for improving the efficiency of your Steamworks, as Steamworks inherently consume Coal to operate and produce handy items. Reducing their coal usage by 20% helps mitigate the consumption penalty associated with industrial buildings.

For context, the High Pressure Engine is one of two upgrades specifically designed to reduce the Coal Production Penalty of Steamworks; the other is the **Fuel Injector**.
