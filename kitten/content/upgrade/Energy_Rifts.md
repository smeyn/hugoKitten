+++
An **Energy Rift** is a vital mid-to-late-game Workshop upgrade that transforms the [Accelerator]( {{< relref "buildings/Accelerator.md" >}}) building from a simple industrial refiner into a massive storage facility. While Accelerators initially only consume energy to refine titanium into uranium, this upgrade allows them to "create rifts to pocket dimensions," granting them significant storage capacity across several resources.

### **Unlocking and Costs**
To access Energy Rifts, you must follow a specific scientific path:
*   **Prerequisite Technology:** You must research [Dimensional Physics]( {{< relref "techs/Dimensional_Physics.md" >}}) (which itself requires [Particle Physics]( {{< relref "techs/Particle_Physics.md" >}})).
*   **Upgrade Cost:** Purchasing the upgrade in the Workshop requires **200k Science**, **7,500 Titanium**, and **250 Uranium**.

### **Storage Effects**
Once the upgrade is active, every Accelerator built provides a substantial boost to your maximum storage caps. The specific bonuses per Accelerator include:
*   **Catnip:** +30,000
*   **Wood:** +20,000
*   **Minerals:** +25,000
*   **Iron:** +7,500
*   [Coal:]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}) +2,500
*   [Gold:]( {{< relref "resource/Gold.md" >}}) +250
*   [Titanium:]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) +750

### **Scaling and Synergies**
The storage provided by Energy Rifts is the foundation for further endgame scaling through several sequential Workshop upgrades:
*   [Stasis Chambers:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Stasis_Chambers.md" >}}) Makes Energy Rifts **twice as effective** (+95% bonus).
*   [Void Energy:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Void_Energy.md" >}}) Provides an additional **+75%** bonus to the storage ratio.
*   [Dark Energy:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Dark_Energy.md" >}}) Increases effectiveness by **2.5 times** (+250% bonus).
*   [Tachyon Accelerators:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Tachyon_Accelerators.md" >}}) Increases effectiveness by **5 times** (+500% bonus).

### **Strategic Utility**
In the late game, Energy Rifts are considered a primary solution for the **titanium storage bottleneck**. While standard storage buildings like Harbours and Warehouses eventually hit diminishing returns or become too expensive, the additive +750 titanium storage per Accelerator (further multiplied by upgrades like Stasis Chambers) allows players to reach the high titanium caps necessary for advanced space missions and eludium crafting. 

However, players must manage the **energy cost** of these rifts; while the storage is passive, the Accelerator building itself consumes **2 Watts** of energy and is an "active" consumer of titanium for uranium production.
