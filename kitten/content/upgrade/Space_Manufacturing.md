[Space Manufacturing]( {{< relref "upgrade/Space_Manufacturing.md" >}}) is a critical late-game Workshop upgrade that serves as the primary multiplier for space-based resource production. It fundamentally shifts the economy by allowing terrestrial **Factories** to enhance the effectiveness of orbital infrastructure.

### **Unlocking and Costs**
To access Space Manufacturing, you must first research the [Superconductors]( {{< relref "techs/Superconductors.md" >}}) technology. Once unlocked, the upgrade can be purchased in the Workshop for:
*   [Science:]( {{< relref "resource/science.md" >}}) 250,000
*   [Titanium:]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) 125,000

Reaching the **125,000 Titanium cap** is often a significant hurdle for players. The sources recommend increasing storage capacity through [Paragon]( {{< relref "resource/paragon.md" >}}), **Cryostations**, **Moon Bases**, and [Accelerators]( {{< relref "buildings/Accelerator.md" >}}) (with the Energy Rift upgrade) to satisfy this requirement.

### **Core Mechanics and Scaling**
The primary function of Space Manufacturing is to provide a "Space Bonus" based on your number of Factories. 
*   **Base Effect:** Each Factory provides a bonus to space production equal to **75% of the factory craft ratio**. 
*   **Specific Modifiers:** It specifically increases the production bonus provided by [Space Elevators]( {{< relref "space/space_elevator.md" >}}) and [Orbital Arrays]( {{< relref "space/orbital_array.md" >}}) by **3.75% per factory**. 
*   **Synergy:** If you have researched [Factory Logistics]( {{< relref "upgrade/Factory_Logistics.md" >}}), this bonus is further improved to **4.5% per factory**.
*   **Exclusions:** It is important to note that this bonus **does not apply to Planet Crackers**.

### **Strategic Importance**
The acquisition of Space Manufacturing is considered a turning point in the "Titanium Era" and beyond for several reasons:
*   **Validating Space Infrastructure:** Before this upgrade, [Space Elevators]( {{< relref "space/space_elevator.md" >}}) are generally considered not worth their high construction cost; however, Space Manufacturing makes them highly useful for scaling production.
*   **Unobtainium Production:** By boosting the effectiveness of Space Elevators and Orbital Arrays, Space Manufacturing significantly accelerates the production of [Unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}}) from Lunar Outposts. 
*   **Late-Game Efficiency:** The "Space Production Bonus" derived from this upgrade is a core component in calculating the return on investment for late-game structures. For example, in short runs, it helps determine the exact point at which building additional Space Elevators becomes profitable.
*   **Industrial Integration:** It represents a deeper integration of the village's industrial base with its space program, utilizing the [Full Industrialization]( {{< relref "Policy/Full_Industrialization.md" >}}) policy to further refine the effectiveness of Factories.
