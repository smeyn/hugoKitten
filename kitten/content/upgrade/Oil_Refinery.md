[Oil Refinery]( {{< relref "upgrade/Oil_Refinery.md" >}}) is a mid-game **workshop upgrade** that increases the resource output of your [Oil Wells]( {{< relref "buildings/Oil_Well.md" >}}). It is unlocked by researching the [Combustion]( {{< relref "techs/Combustion.md" >}}) technology and serves as a key efficiency modifier during the transition from terrestrial industry to space exploration.

### **Costs and Requirements**
To purchase the Oil Refinery upgrade, you must invest the following resources:
*   **125,000 Science**
*   **1,250 Titanium**
*   **500 Gears**

The prerequisite technology, [Combustion]( {{< relref "techs/Combustion.md" >}}), requires **115,000 Science and 45 Blueprints**.

### **Mechanical Effects**
The primary function of the Oil Refinery is to provide a flat **+35% production bonus** to all active Oil Wells. This bonus is **additive** with other terrestrial oil production upgrades:
*   [Pumpjack:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Pumpjack.md" >}}) Provides a +45% production boost but adds a 1-Watt energy cost to each Oil Well.
*   [Oil Distillation:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Oil_Distillation.md" >}}) Provides a +75% production boost.
*   [Factory Processing:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Factory_Processing.md" >}}) Increases oil refinement effectiveness by **5% for every active Factory**.

### **Strategic Utility**
The Oil Refinery is a critical component for overcoming the **oil bottleneck** that often occurs before the establishment of high-output space structures. 

1.  **Scaling for Space Missions:** Early space milestones have high oil requirements that far exceed base storage and production rates. For example, an [Orbital Launch]( {{< relref "space/Orbital_Launch.md" >}}) requires 15,000 oil, a [Moon Mission]( {{< relref "space/Moon_Mission.md" >}}) requires 45,000, and a **Moon Base** requires 70,000. The 35% boost from refineries helps fill these high caps in a reasonable timeframe.
2.  **Mitigating Production Slumps:** Oil production is inherently slow compared to wood or minerals. By stacking the refinery bonus with **Pumpjacks and Oil Distillation**, players can achieve a terrestrial production rate capable of sustaining the creation of [Kerosene]( {{< relref "resource/kerosene.md" >}}) for rocket fuel.
3.  **Industrial Independence:** Increasing Oil Well efficiency reduces the need to rely on [Bio Labs]( {{< relref "buildings/Bio_Lab.md" >}}) and [Biofuel Processing]( {{< relref "upgrade/Biofuel_Processing.md" >}}) for oil production, allowing those buildings to focus on expanding the **science cap**.

Strategic advice recommends purchasing the Oil Refinery as soon as [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) production is stabilised through trade with Zebras, as the increased oil flow is necessary to power **Calciners and Magnetos** while still saving enough for space mission fuel.
