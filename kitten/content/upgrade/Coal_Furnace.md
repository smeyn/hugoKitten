The [Coal Furnace]( {{< relref "upgrade/Coal_Furnace.md" >}}) is a vital **Workshop upgrade** in *Kittens Game* used to establish an early supply of Coal.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the upgrade:

### Prerequisites and Cost

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** The Coal Furnace upgrade is unlocked once you research the [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Cost:** Acquiring the Coal Furnace requires **5,000 Science**, **5,000 Minerals**, **2,000 Iron**, and **35 Beam**.

### Function and Strategic Importance

The Coal Furnace upgrade affects your [Smelters]( {{< relref "buildings/Smelter.md" >}}), which are industrial buildings primarily used to create Iron and Gold.

*   **Effect:** It allows your Smelters to **produce Coal** while simultaneously burning wood.
*   **Production Rate:** The Smelters generate Coal at a rate of **0.005 coal per tick** (which is 0.025 per second).

The Coal Furnace is one of two key upgrades (the other being [Deep Mining]( {{< relref "upgrade/Deep_Mining.md" >}})) introduced when you research Steel that enable you to accumulate [Coal]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}). Coal is essential later in the game because it is consumed to power advanced buildings, such as the [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}).

Strategically, players are advised to prioritize researching [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) 
first (over Philosophy or Machinery) to immediately access upgrades like the Coal Furnace, 
which helps strengthen the foundational economy. However, once you research Steel and 
the related coal upgrades, the general advice is to acquire the necessary workshop upgrades, 
then allow Coal to max out, as Coal is used to produce Iron which is highly valuable
 for building [Lumber Mills]( {{< relref "buildings/Lumber_Mill.md" >}}) 
 and [Observatories]( {{< relref "buildings/Observatory.md" >}}).
