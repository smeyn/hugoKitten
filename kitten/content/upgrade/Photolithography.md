[Photolithography]( {{< relref "upgrade/Photolithography.md" >}}) is a highly effective late-game Workshop upgrade in *Kittens Game* that significantly increases the automated production rate of [Manuscripts]( {{< relref "resource/manuscript.md" >}}) within the [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}) building.

### Details and Effects

| Category | Specification | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | Workshop Upgrade for Steamworks | |
| **Prerequisite Technology** | [Satellites]( {{< relref "techs/Satellites.md" >}}) | |
| **Cost** | 250,000 Science, 1,250 Alloy, 50,000 Oil, and 250 Uranium | |
| **Effect** | The printing press becomes **four times as effective** |, |
| **New Production Rate** | Steamworks produce **0.04 manuscripts/sec** | |

### Progression and Context

Photolithography represents the final stage of automated manuscript production, following the initial [Printing Press]( {{< relref "upgrade/Printing_Press.md" >}}) upgrade (unlocked by Machinery) and the intermediate [Offset Press]( {{< relref "upgrade/Offset_Press.md" >}}) (unlocked by Combustion),,.

*   The Printing Press establishes the base automated rate of $0.0025$ manuscripts/sec.
*   The Offset Press increases this rate by a factor of four, up to $0.01$ manuscripts/sec.
*   Photolithography applies another fourfold multiplier, boosting the output to **$0.04$ manuscripts/sec**,.

This upgrade is crucial for maintaining rapid scientific and religious progression in the late game, where Manuscripts are required for high-tier research (like [Astronomy]( {{< relref "techs/Astronomy.md" >}}) and [Theology]( {{< relref "science/theology.md" >}})) and building [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}),. Automated manuscript production ensures that the flow of this vital cultural resource keeps pace with the increasing demands of high-level technology,.
