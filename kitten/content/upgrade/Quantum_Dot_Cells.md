[Quantum Dot Cells]( {{< relref "upgrade/Quantum_Dot_Cells.md" >}}) is a Workshop upgrade in *Kittens Game* that enhances the energy production of [Solar Farms]( {{< relref "buildings/Solar_Farm.md" >}}).

### Details of Quantum Dot Cells

| Category | Specification | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | Workshop Upgrade for Solar Farms | |
| **Prerequisite Technology** | [Thorium]( {{< relref "resource/thorium.md" >}}) |, |
| **Cost** | 175,000 Science, 200 Eludium, and 1,000 Thorium | |
| **Effect** | Increases Solar Farm energy production by **+15% in winter** (additive with Thin Film Cells) and **+30% in spring and autumn** | |

This upgrade is part of a progression pathway for improving Solar Farm efficiency, following the Photovoltaic Cells upgrade (which gives +50% energy production), and Thin Film Cells (which also boosts winter energy production by +15%). The prerequisite, [Thorium]( {{< relref "resource/thorium.md" >}}) science, is a mid-to-late game technology that costs 375,000 Science and 375 Blueprints. Solar Farms are themselves the upgraded replacement for Pastures, unlocked via [Ecology]( {{< relref "techs/Ecology.md" >}}) science, and they provide energy,,.q
