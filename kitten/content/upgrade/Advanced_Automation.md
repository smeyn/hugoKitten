The term [Advanced Automation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Advanced_Automation.md" >}}) refers to a crucial **Workshop upgrade** in *Kittens Game* that enhances the efficiency of your industrial production system.

Here are the specific details regarding this upgrade:

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** Advanced Automation is unlocked by researching the [Industrialization]( {{< relref "techs/Industrialization.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Building Association:** This upgrade is associated with the [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}) building.
*   **Cost:** The upgrade requires **100,000 Science**, **75 Gears**, and **25 Blueprints**.
*   **Effect:** The Advanced Automation upgrade causes the core [Workshop Automation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Workshop_Automation.md" >}}) function to be activated **twice per year**.
*   **Timing:** The source notes the upgrade specifically triggers "Steamworks Production: Fall". Since the original Workshop Automation occurs in Spring, Advanced Automation allows this useful conversion process to run during a second season.

**Context of Workshop Automation:**
The Workshop Automation function itself (unlocked by the Machinery technology) converts small quantities of resources (Wood into Beams and Minerals into Slabs) when those resources are near 98% of their storage limit, typically occurring annually in Spring. Advanced Automation doubles the frequency of this passive resource management, making it more effective at preventing resource bottlenecks and generating necessary materials automatically.
