[Photovoltaic Cells]( {{< relref "upgrade/Photovoltaic_Cells.md" >}}) is a workshop upgrade that significantly increases the power output of your [Solar Farms]( {{< relref "buildings/Solar_Farm.md" >}}). The upgrade requires the [Nanotechnology]( {{< relref "techs/Nanotechnology.md" >}}) technology to be researched before it becomes available in the workshop menu. To purchase this enhancement, you must invest **75,000 Science** and **5,000 Titanium**.

Once purchased, it provides a **+50% bonus** to the energy production of all constructed Solar Farms. This efficiency modifier is uniquely powerful because it **multiplies with other effects** affecting Solar Farm output. Solar Farms are a mid-to-late-game structure that replaces [Pastures]( {{< relref "buildings/Pasture.md" >}}), and their base energy production fluctuates according to the seasons, with peak output occurring during **Summer**.

The bonus from Photovoltaic Cells functions alongside other specialised solar upgrades, such as [Thin Film Cells]( {{< relref "upgrade/Thin_Film_Cells.md" >}}), which provides a +15% boost during winter, and [Quantum Dot Cells]( {{< relref "upgrade/Quantum_Dot_Cells.md" >}}), which adds further percentage bonuses across the entire year. Stabilising energy production through this upgrade is a critical step in powering high-consumption industrial buildings and advanced space missions.
