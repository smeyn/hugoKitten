[Barges]( {{< relref "upgrade/Barges.md" >}}) is a mid-game **workshop upgrade** that significantly expands your colony's energy and industrial capacity by increasing the **maximum coal storage from Harbours by 50%**.

### **Costs and Unlocking**
To access the Barges upgrade, you must first research the **Industrialisation** technology. Once unlocked, the upgrade requires the following resources to purchase:
*   **100,000 Science**
*   **1,500 Titanium**
*   **30 Blueprints**

### **Mechanical Effects**
The primary function of Barges is to enhance the utility of [Harbours]( {{< relref "buildings/Harbour.md" >}}), which are high-capacity storage buildings unlocked by [Navigation]( {{< relref "techs/Navigation.md" >}}). 
*   **Storage Scaling:** While a base Harbour provides **+100 max coal**, the Barges upgrade applies a **50% increase** to this specific contribution.
*   **Multiplicative Interaction:** The bonus from Barges is unique because it **multiplies with other effects** affecting Harbour storage, rather than just being added to the base value. This synergy makes it increasingly valuable as you construct more Harbours and acquire other storage multipliers.

### **Strategic Utility**
Expanding coal storage is a critical step in transitioning to heavy industry:
*   **Steel Production:** Coal is a mandatory component for crafting [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) (100 coal and 100 iron), which is used for advanced components like **Gears and Alloy**.
*   **Steamworks Management:** Coal is the primary fuel for [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}), which provide a boost to [Magnetos]( {{< relref "buildings/Magneto.md" >}}) and can automate the production of manuscripts. However, Steamworks consume a large amount of coal, making high storage caps necessary to prevent production slumps.
*   **Overcoming terrestrial limits:** As terrestrial buildings like [Barns]( {{< relref "buildings/Barn.md" >}}) and [Warehouses]( {{< relref "buildings/Warehouse.md" >}}) reach their cost-prohibitive levels, Harbours (enhanced by Barges and [Expanded Cargo]( {{< relref "upgrade/Expanded_Cargo.md" >}})) become the most efficient way to scale storage for the resources needed to reach the **Space Era**.
