Oil Distillation refers to a specific **Workshop upgrade** in *Kittens Game*.

Here is a breakdown of the relevant information regarding this upgrade:

*   **Prerequisite:** The Oil Distillation upgrade is unlocked after researching the [Rocketry]( {{< relref "techs/Rocketry.md" >}}) technology. Rocketry itself is unlocked by Electronics.
*   **Cost:** The upgrade requires **175,000 Science** and **5,000 Titanium**.
*   **Effect:** Oil Distillation provides a significant boost to your oil production, as it **improves Oil Well output by 75%**. The Oil Well building description explicitly notes this upgrade's effect: "+75%".
*   **Mechanics:** This 75% bonus to Oil Well output is additive with other oil output boosters, such as the bonuses received from the Oil Refinery and Pumpjack upgrades.

The Oil Processing technology, which enables the creation of Kerosene, is associated with the Oil Distillation upgrade.

This upgrade is often sought in the late-game or Titanium era, as Titanium is required for purchase, and it is listed among the useful workshop upgrades to push for once you reach the point of expanding oil production.
