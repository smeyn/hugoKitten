[Uplink]( {{< relref "upgrade/Uplink.md" >}}) is a mid-to-late-game **workshop upgrade** that establishes a symbiotic relationship between your terrestrial science buildings. It is unlocked after researching the [Satellites]( {{< relref "techs/Satellites.md" >}}) technology and requires **75,000 Science** and **1,750 Alloy** to purchase.

### **Mechanical Effects**
The upgrade provides percentage-based bonuses to the storage and production capacities of [Bio Labs]( {{< relref "buildings/Bio_Lab.md" >}}) and **Data Centres** based on the number of each building currently constructed:

*   **For Data Centres:** Each Bio Lab provides a **+1% bonus to maximum science**, **+1% to maximum culture**, and **+1% to the compendium cap**.
*   **For Bio Labs:** Each Data Centre provides a **+1% bonus to maximum science**.

### **Strategic Utility**
Uplink is a critical tool for scaling your **science and culture caps** without solely relying on the construction of new buildings, which become increasingly expensive due to price ratios. 

1.  **Science Cap Expansion:** By linking Data Centres (upgraded Libraries) and Bio Labs, the upgrade allows players to reach the high science thresholds required for advanced technologies like **Particle Physics (185k Science)** or **Chronophysics (250k Science)**. 
2.  **Compendium Efficiency:** The +1% bonus to the compendium cap per Bio Lab is particularly valuable. Because compendiums increase science storage by a flat amount (+10), expanding the cap through Uplink allows these crafted resources to provide a significantly higher total storage limit.
3.  **Synergy with Starlink:** The benefits of Uplink can be further enhanced by the [Starlink]( {{< relref "upgrade/Starlink.md" >}}) workshop upgrade, which provides an **additional +1% science bonus** to Bio Labs for every Data Centre.

This upgrade is essential for transitioning into the **Space and Chronophysics eras**, where terrestrial buildings alone often fail to provide the storage capacity necessary to progress.
