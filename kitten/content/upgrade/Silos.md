The query refers to [Silos]( {{< relref "upgrade/Silos.md" >}}), which is a highly important Workshop upgrade in *Kittens Game* focused on expanding resource storage, particularly for **Catnip**.

### 1. Unlocking and Cost

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** Silos is unlocked after researching [Ironwood Huts]( {{< relref "upgrade/Ironwood_Huts.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:** Researching the Silos upgrade requires **50,000 Science**, **125 Steel**, and **5 Blueprints**.

### 2. Key Effects and Functionality

Silos fundamentally changes how resource storage buildings (Barns, Warehouses, and Harbours) function by enabling the storage of Catnip in structures beyond just Barns, and by enhancing the effectiveness of all general storage upgrades.

*   **Warehouse Catnip Storage:** After Silos is researched, each [Warehouse]( {{< relref "buildings/Warehouse.md" >}}) begins to increase maximum **Catnip** capacity by **+750**. Warehouses are initially unlocked by researching Construction.
*   **Barn Upgrade Bonus Application:** Silos causes all storage upgrades that contain the word "barns" in their name (e.g., Expanded Barns, Reinforced Barns, Titanium Barns, Alloy Barns, Concrete Barns, and Concrete Pillars) to apply **25% of their effect** to the maximum **Catnip** capacity as well. This dramatically boosts Catnip storage capacity. For example, the maximum total bonus applied to Catnip storage via this mechanic from all relevant upgrades is **$+108.75\%$**.
*   **Warehouse and Harbour Storage Bonus:** This same bonus calculation also applies to the Catnip capacity provided by [Warehouses]( {{< relref "buildings/Warehouse.md" >}}) and [Harbours]( {{< relref "buildings/Harbour.md" >}}).

### 3. Strategic Importance

This upgrade is vital in the mid-game, as managing the Catnip surplus and deficit is a core mechanic of the game.

*   **Catnip Stability:** While the base Catnip storage capacity starts at 5,000, each Kitten consumes 4.25 Catnip per second. Expanding storage capacity is crucial for surviving harsh **Winters**, where Catnip production from Catnip Fields can drop by 75% or more. Silos allows the player to overcome storage limits and build up massive stockpiles needed for long-term food security and efficient wood refinement.
*   **Technological Progression:** The ability to craft this upgrade requires a decent industrial base to produce [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) and acquire [Blueprints]( {{< relref "resource/Blueprint.md" >}}).

***
Think of Silos as converting your general storage buildings into food warehouses. Before Silos, only specialised agricultural structures (Barns) could hold your food supply, limiting your stockpile size. With Silos, every Warehouse and Harbour you build can now help keep your community fed, turning industrial storage into emergency reserves.
