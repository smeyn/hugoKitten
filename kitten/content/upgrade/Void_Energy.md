[Void Energy]( {{< relref "upgrade/Void_Energy.md" >}}) is a mid-to-late game **workshop upgrade** designed to significantly expand the resource storage capacity provided by [Accelerators]( {{< relref "buildings/Accelerator.md" >}}). This upgrade is a critical component of the "Energy Rift" storage chain, which allows industrial buildings to compete with terrestrial storage like Barns and Warehouses.

### **Costs and Prerequisites**
To purchase Void Energy, you must first research the [Stasis Chambers]( {{< relref "upgrade/Stasis_Chambers.md" >}}) workshop upgrade. The upgrade requires the following resources:
*   **275,000 Science**
*   **250 Alloy**
*   **2,500 Uranium**
*   **2 Time Crystals**

The inclusion of [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}) in the cost indicates that Void Energy is a gateway upgrade into the [Chronophysics]( {{< relref "techs/Chronophysics.md" >}}) era, where temporal resources begin to influence standard terrestrial infrastructure.

### **Mechanical Effects on Storage**
The primary function of Void Energy is to make [Energy Rifts]( {{< relref "upgrade/Energy_Rifts.md" >}}) (the initial storage-enabling upgrade for Accelerators) "even more effective". 
*   **Storage Bonus:** It provides a flat **+75% increase** to the resource storage ratio for Accelerators.
*   **Affected Resources:** This bonus applies to the maximum capacity of **catnip, wood, minerals, coal, iron, titanium, and gold**.
*   **Additive Scaling:** The +75% bonus stacks additively with other Accelerator storage upgrades. In a fully optimized late-game setup, Void Energy contributes to a total maximum Accelerator storage bonus of **+920%** when combined with Stasis Chambers (+95%), Dark Energy (+250%), and Tachyon Accelerators (+500%).

### **Strategic Utility**
Void Energy is essential for overcoming the **resource storage "caps"** that act as a primary bottleneck for late-game progression. Once buildings like Mansions or advanced Space Missions cost more than your maximum storage allows, progress halts until those caps are raised. 

Because [Accelerators]( {{< relref "buildings/Accelerator.md" >}}) primarily produce Uranium and consume Titanium, the Energy Rift chain (including Void Energy) allows players to repurpose their industrial power into a massive storage solution. This is particularly useful for reaching the high **Titanium and Science caps** required for the **Eludium and Relic eras**, as terrestrial buildings eventually become prohibitively expensive due to steep price ratios. Proper investment in these upgrades allows Accelerators to provide a substantial percentage of a colony's total storage, often surpassing the utility of Harbours in the very late game.
