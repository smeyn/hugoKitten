The [Expanded Barns]( {{< relref "expanded_barns.md" >}}) upgrade is a storage improvement available in the [Workshop]( {{< relref "workshop.md" >}}) tab of *Kittens Game*, specifically designed to increase your capacity for core resources.

Here is a detailed explanation based on the sources:

### Function and Effects

The primary effect of Expanded Barns is to increase the maximum resource limits of your essential storage buildings:

*   **Storage Increase:** The upgrade increases the maximum storage for **wood, minerals, and iron** provided by **Barns, Warehouses, and Harbors** by **75%**.
*   **Catnip Bonus (Conditional):** If the [Silos]( {{< relref "silos.md" >}}) upgrade is purchased, Expanded Barns, along with all other storage upgrades containing the word "barns" in their name, will apply **25% of their effect to maximum Catnip storage** as well.

This upgrade is crucial because resource storage limits are a major bottleneck that can greatly slow progress in the game.

### Cost and Prerequisites

Expanded Barns is an early-game upgrade, available before more advanced storage solutions are developed:

*   **Cost:** The upgrade costs **500 Science**, **1,000 Wood**, **750 Minerals**, and **50 Iron**.
*   **Prerequisite:** There is no specific prerequisite listed for this upgrade in the source material (indicated by a dash in the prerequisite column of the storage table). The foundational building it upgrades, the [Barn]( {{< relref "barn.md" >}}), is unlocked after researching [Agriculture]( {{< relref "agriculture.md" >}}).

### Context within Storage Progression

Expanded Barns is part of a series of storage upgrades designed to continuously increase the capacity provided by Barns and related structures:

| Upgrade | Effect on Max Storage (Wood, Minerals, Iron) |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Expanded Barns]( {{< relref "expanded_barns.md" >}}) | +75% increase |
| [Reinforced Barns]( {{< relref "reinforced_barns.md" >}}) | +80% increase |
| [Titanium Barns]( {{< relref "titanium_barns.md" >}}) | +100% increase (twice as many resources) |
| [Alloy Barns]( {{< relref "alloy_barns.md" >}}) | +100% increase (twice as many resources) |
| [Concrete Barns]( {{< relref "concrete_barns.md" >}}) | +75% increase |

Building [Barns]( {{< relref "buildings/Barn.md" >}}) is advised early on, as they are essential for increasing the capacity for Catnip and Wood, which helps in surviving the challenges of **Winter**.

***

**Analogy:** If your civilization's maximum resource storage is a set of buckets, the [Expanded Barns]( {{< relref "expanded_barns.md" >}}) upgrade acts like slightly increasing the size of those initial buckets (Barns, Warehouses, Harbors). This allows you to accumulate a larger reserve of core building materials (wood, minerals, iron) before hitting the resource cap, similar to how adding a larger fuel tank allows a car to travel further between refueling stops.
