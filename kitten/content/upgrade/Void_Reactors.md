[Void Reactors]( {{< relref "upgrade/Void_Reactors.md" >}}) is a late-game workshop upgrade that significantly scales your scientific capacity by improving the effectiveness of specific space structures. It requires a substantial investment of **250 Void** and **2,500 Antimatter** to purchase. To unlock this upgrade, you must first research the [Advanced AM Reactors]( {{< relref "upgrade/Advanced_AM_Reactors.md" >}}) workshop upgrade.

### **Mechanical Effects and Bonuses**
The primary function of Void Reactors is to expand your maximum science cap through the following structures:
*   **Research Vessels:** Equipping these vessels with Void Reactors increases their contribution to your **maximum science by 400%**.
*   **Space Beacons:** Similar to research vessels, this upgrade increases the science storage provided by each Space Beacon by **400%**.

### **Strategic Utility**
In the late-game "Relic Era", increasing your science cap becomes a critical bottleneck for unlocking endgame technologies like [Paradox Theory]( {{< relref "techs/Paradox_Theory.md" >}}) (1M Science) and [Exophysics]( {{< relref "techs/Exophysics.md" >}}) (25M Science). Void Reactors are considered essential for reaching these storage thresholds without needing to build an excessive number of terrestrial buildings like Libraries or Academies. Because the upgrade scales based on structures that are already established for Starchart or Relic production, it provides a high return on investment for players moving toward the "Chrono-Optimization" phase of the game.

### **Late-Game Context**
While terrestrial buildings like **Data Centres** and [Bio Labs]( {{< relref "buildings/Bio_Lab.md" >}}) provide science storage, their effectiveness is eventually dwarfed by upgraded space structures. The 400% boost from Void Reactors represents the highest tier of science storage efficiency available for these structures, surpassing the bonuses provided by standard Antimatter Reactors (95%) and Advanced AM Reactors (150%). Accessing this level of storage is necessary for performing the "Positive Resets" required to establish a self-sustaining resource loop.
