While the provided sources do not list an upgrade specifically named the [Unobtainium Saw]( {{< relref "upgrade/Unobtainium_Saw.md" >}}), the **saw upgrade chain** for Lumber Mills concludes with the [Alloy Saw]( {{< relref "upgrade/Alloy_Saw.md" >}}). This terminal saw upgrade requires **85,000 Science and 75 Alloy** and improves Lumber Mill efficiency by **15%**. 

Although a saw of this tier is absent, the **Woodcutter job** features a late-game tool upgrade called the [Unobtainium Axe]( {{< relref "upgrade/Unobtainium_Axe.md" >}}) to boost raw wood production. Similarly, the **Geologist job** can be enhanced with the [Unobtainium Drill]( {{< relref "upgrade/Unobtainium_Drill.md" >}}) workshop upgrade, which is unlocked after researching [Exogeology]( {{< relref "resource/exogeology.md" >}}). The Unobtainium Drill costs **250,000 Science, 250 Unobtainium, and 1,250 Alloy**, providing geologists with **+0.015 coal per tick** and a potential gold bonus if [Geodesy]( {{< relref "upgrade/Geodesy.md" >}}) is active.

Unobtainium is used for several other high-tier efficiency and storage upgrades:
*   [Unobtainium Huts:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Unobtainium_Huts.md" >}}) Reduces the price ratio of Huts by **25%**, allowing for significantly higher population caps.
*   [Unobtainium Reflectors:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Unobtainium_Reflectors.md" >}}) Increases the maximum science capacity provided by each **Observatory by 2%**.
*   [Storage Bunkers:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Storage_Bunkers.md" >}}) Uses unobtainium and concrete to increase the storage capacity of Warehouses, Barns, Harbours, and Mints by **20%**.
*   [Eludium:]( {{< relref "resource/eludium.md" >}}) Unobtainium is a required material for crafting [Eludium]( {{< relref "resource/eludium.md" >}}), a composite of 1,000 Unobtainium and 2,500 Alloy used for endgame space structures.

The primary method for acquiring unobtainium is refining [Uranium]( {{< relref "resource/uranium.md" >}}) at a [Lunar Outpost]( {{< relref "planet/lunar_outpost.md" >}}) on Redmoon, a process that consumes 1.75 Uranium per second to produce **0.035 Unobtainium per second**.
