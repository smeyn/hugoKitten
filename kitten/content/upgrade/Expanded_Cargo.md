[Expanded Cargo]( {{< relref "upgrade/Expanded_Cargo.md" >}}) is a significant mid-game upgrade focused on augmenting the storage capacity provided by [Harbours]( {{< relref "buildings/Harbour.md" >}}), which are structures essential for managing resources acquired through trading.

### Details and Effects

| Detail | Specification | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | Workshop Upgrade | |
| **Prerequisite** | Unlocked after researching the [Navigation]( {{< relref "techs/Navigation.md" >}}) technology | |
| **Cost** | 55,000 Science and 15 Blueprints | |
| **Effect** | Each [Trade Ship]( {{< relref "craft/Trade_Ship.md" >}}) provides a **+1% bonus** to **Harbour capacity** |,, |

### Storage Expansion Specifics

The bonus provided by Expanded Cargo applies to all resources stored by Harbours, including Catnip.

*   The increased storage scales with the number of Trade Ships you possess.
*   The bonus is subject to **diminishing returns** starting past **168.75\%**, with a maximum limit of **225\%**,,.
*   This maximum capacity limit can be further increased by subsequent research: the [Reactor Vessel]( {{< relref "upgrade/Reactor_Vessel.md" >}}) upgrade adds a **+5\%** increase to the Harbour capacity limit per [Reactor]( {{< relref "buildings/Reactor.md" >}}).

Expanded Cargo is important because, as you acquire more Trade Ships to accelerate titanium and iron gathering via trading with Zebras,, it concurrently boosts the capacity of your Harbours, helping to manage the large volumes of resources generated through trade.
