The [LHC]( {{< relref "upgrade/LHC.md" >}}) (Large Hadron Collider) is a high-tier Workshop upgrade for the [Accelerator]( {{< relref "buildings/Accelerator.md" >}}) building, designed to significantly expand your colony's scientific capacity. 

### **Unlocking and Requirements**
*   **Technological Path:** The LHC is unlocked by researching [Dimensional Physics]( {{< relref "techs/Dimensional_Physics.md" >}}), which itself requires [Particle Physics]( {{< relref "techs/Particle_Physics.md" >}}).
*   **Building Prerequisite:** To benefit from this upgrade, you must have constructed [Accelerators]( {{< relref "buildings/Accelerator.md" >}}), which are energy-intensive buildings used to refine titanium into uranium.

### **Primary Effects and Scaling**
Once purchased, the LHC provides a substantial boost to your maximum science storage:
*   **Science Storage Bonus:** Every Accelerator in your village provides a flat **+2500 bonus to maximum science**.
*   **Scientific Progression:** This upgrade is a critical component of the late-game science infrastructure. It allows Accelerators to contribute to your total science cap alongside other major structures like **Data Centres** (+750 science), [Bio Labs]( {{< relref "buildings/Bio_Lab.md" >}}) (+1500 science), and **Space Beacons** (+25,000 science).

### **Strategic Utility**
The LHC is essential for breaking through the **"science ceiling"** required for the most advanced technologies in the game. While early-game storage relies on Libraries and Academies, the escalating costs of late-game research—such as [Quantum Cryptography]( {{< relref "techs/Quantum_Cryptography.md" >}}) (1.25M science) and [Exophysics]( {{< relref "techs/Exophysics.md" >}}) (25M science)—necessitate the massive science storage bonuses provided by LHC-upgraded Accelerators.

When combined with [Energy Rifts]( {{< relref "upgrade/Energy_Rifts.md" >}}) (another Accelerator upgrade that expands general resource storage), the LHC transforms the Accelerator from a simple industrial refiner into one of the most versatile and powerful storage facilities available to your kittens.
