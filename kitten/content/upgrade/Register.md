[Register]( {{< relref "upgrade/Register.md" >}}) is a workshop upgrade that improves kitten workforce efficiency by allowing a leader to manage job assignments based on experience. It is unlocked once you have researched the [Writing]( {{< relref "techs/Writing.md" >}}) technology and requires **500 Science** and **10 Gold** to purchase.

### **Mechanical Effects**
The upgrade automates the optimisation of kitten skills during the assignment process:
*   **Skill Prioritisation:** When adding kittens to a job, the system automatically selects kittens with the highest relevant experience levels first.
*   **Retention of Expertise:** Conversely, when unassigning kittens from a job, those with the least experience are removed first, ensuring your most proficient workers remain in their roles.
*   **Leader Requirement:** This functionality only active if a **Leader** has been appointed via the Census (unlocked by [Civil Service]( {{< relref "techs/Civil_Service.md" >}})).

### **Strategic Utility**
Kittens gain experience over time as they perform specific tasks, progressing through seven skill tiers from **Dabbling** (0% bonus) to **Master** (18.75% bonus). Because these bonuses stack multiplicatively with other productivity modifiers, ensuring the right kittens are in the right jobs is vital for maximising resource output. 

[Register]( {{< relref "upgrade/Register.md" >}}) eliminates the need for manual micro-management of individual kittens within the Census tab. It is particularly useful when players frequently reallocate their workforce to resolve bottlenecks—such as moving all kittens to the [Farmer]( {{< relref "job/Farmer.md" >}}) job to survive a "Cold" winter or shifting them to [Scholars]( {{< relref "job/Scholar.md" >}}) to quickly push through a new technology. Without this upgrade, mass-assigning kittens can inadvertently replace a "Master" worker with a "Dabbling" one, resulting in a significant loss of production efficiency.
