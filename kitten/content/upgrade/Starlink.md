[Starlink]( {{< relref "upgrade/Starlink.md" >}}) is a late-game **workshop upgrade** that enhances the scientific synergy between [Bio Labs]( {{< relref "buildings/Bio_Lab.md" >}}) and **Data Centres**. It is unlocked after researching the [Orbital Engineering]( {{< relref "techs/Orbital_Engineering.md" >}}) technology and requires **175,000 Science, 5,000 Alloy, and 25,000 Oil** to purchase.

### **Mechanical Effects and Synergy**
The primary function of Starlink is to increase the **maximum science capacity** of your colony by linking building counts:
*   **Capacity Bonus:** Every active **Data Centre** provides an **additional 1% bonus** to the maximum science capacity provided by each [Bio Lab]( {{< relref "buildings/Bio_Lab.md" >}}).
*   **Stacking with Uplink:** Starlink acts as a follow-up to the [Uplink]( {{< relref "upgrade/Uplink.md" >}}) upgrade. While Uplink provides an initial 1% bonus to Bio Lab science per Data Centre (and improves Data Centre caps per Bio Lab), **Starlink adds a second 1% modifier**, effectively doubling the contribution Bio Labs receive from your Data Centre infrastructure.

### **Strategic Utility**
Scaling the **maximum science cap** is a critical requirement for late-game progression, as advanced technologies and space missions have resource requirements that eventually exceed base storage limits. Because this bonus is percentage-based and scales with the number of buildings, it allows players to reach the high science thresholds necessary for **Exometallurgy (325,000 Science)**, **Tachyon Theory (750,000 Science)**, and even higher-tier endgame goals. 

By investing in Starlink, you maximise the return on your terrestrial science buildings, reducing the need to rely solely on **Observatories** or high-cost **Research Vessels** to expand your knowledge capacity. This is particularly useful when preparing for [Antimatter]( {{< relref "resource/Antimatter.md" >}}) production or the **Unicorn/Time Crystal Era**, where science caps must be sufficiently high to craft complex components like [Blueprints]( {{< relref "resource/Blueprint.md" >}}) and [Compendiums]( {{< relref "resource/Compendium.md" >}}) in mass quantities.
