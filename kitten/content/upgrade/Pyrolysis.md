[Pyrolysis]( {{< relref "upgrade/Pyrolysis.md" >}}) is a Workshop upgrade in *Kittens Game* that provides a bonus to coal production.

### Details of Pyrolysis

| Category | Specification | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | Workshop Upgrade | |
| **Prerequisite Technology** | [Physics]( {{< relref "techs/Physics.md" >}}) |, |
| **Cost** | **35,000 Science** and **5 Compendiums** | |
| **Effect** | Boosts **Coal output by +20%** (multiplies with other effects) | |
| **Exclusion** | Smelters are specifically **unaffected** by this boost | |

The upgrade is tied to the [Physics]( {{< relref "techs/Physics.md" >}}) technology, which is itself a major mid-game technology requiring 50,000 Science and 35 Compendiums to research. Since Pyrolysis boosts coal production, it is useful for industrial scaling, as Coal is needed to operate Steamworks, which can automate Manuscript production, and is also required for crafting Steel,,.
