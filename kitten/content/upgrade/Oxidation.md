[Oxidation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Oxidation.md" >}}) is a Workshop upgrade available in *Kittens Game* that significantly enhances the output of the [Calciner]( {{< relref "buildings/Calciner.md" >}}) industrial building, specifically boosting its production of iron and titanium.

### Details of Oxidation

| Category | Specification | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | Workshop Upgrade for Calciners |, |
| **Prerequisite Technology** | [Metallurgy]( {{< relref "techs/Metallurgy.md" >}}) |, |
| **Cost** | 100,000 Science and 5,000 Steel | |
| **Effects** | Calciners produce **$+95\%$ more iron**. |, |
| | Calciners produce **$+285\%$ more titanium**. |, |

The Metallurgy technology, which unlocks Oxidation, is itself a high-level industrial science costing 125,000 Science and 60 Blueprints to research.

### Context and Strategic Importance

The Oxidation upgrade provides a massive boost to titanium production ($+285\%$) from Calciners, making it a critical step during the "Titanium era" and subsequent resource phases where titanium is a necessary component for advanced buildings, research, and crafting,. Calciners are complex buildings that already refine iron and titanium from minerals and oil,. Oxidation dramatically increases the efficiency of this conversion process, helping to alleviate titanium bottlenecks,.

Oxidation is one of several upgrades within the Calciner upgrade path, alongside others like [Rotary Kiln]( {{< relref "upgrade/Rotary_Kiln.md" >}}) and [Fluidized Reactors]( {{< relref "upgrade/Fluidized_Reactors.md" >}}), which further enhance iron and titanium output,.
