[Titanium Barns]( {{< relref "titanium_barns.md" >}}) is a powerful storage upgrade available in the [Workshop]( {{< relref "workshop.md" >}}) tab of *Kittens Game*, specifically designed to increase your capacity for common resources.

### Function and Effects

The primary effect of the Titanium Barns upgrade is to significantly increase the storage capacity provided by your fundamental storage structures:

*   **Storage Increase:** Titanium Barns causes storage facilities to store **twice as many resources**.
*   **Specific Resources Affected:** This upgrade increases the maximum storage for **wood, minerals, and iron** provided by **Barns, Warehouses, and Harbors** by **100%**.

This capacity increase is vital, as reaching resource storage limits ("caps") is a major bottleneck that greatly slows progress in the game.

### Cost and Prerequisites

To purchase Titanium Barns, you must have previously acquired the necessary predecessor upgrade and accumulated substantial resources:

*   **Prerequisite:** The upgrade requires you to have already purchased [Reinforced Barns]( {{< relref "reinforced_barns.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:**
    *   Science: **60,000**.
    *   Titanium: **25**.
    *   Steel: **200**.
    *   Scaffold: **250**.

### Context in Storage Progression

Titanium Barns is one of several upgrades available for the basic [Barn]( {{< relref "barn.md" >}}) structure, which is initially unlocked after researching [Agriculture]( {{< relref "agriculture.md" >}}). It belongs to a line of barn-related upgrades intended to manage increasing resource needs, following upgrades like Expanded Barn and Reinforced Barns.

It is important to note that if you research [Exogeology]( {{< relref "techs/Exogeology.md" >}}), you unlock [Unobtainium Huts]( {{< relref "unobtainium_huts.md" >}}) and the [Storage Bunkers]( {{< relref "storage_bunkers.md" >}}) upgrade, the latter of which provides an additional **+20%** storage increase for a variety of resources (wood, minerals, iron, etc.).
