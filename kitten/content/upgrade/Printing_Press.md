The [Printing Press]( {{< relref "upgrade/Printing_Press.md" >}}) is a vital Workshop upgrade in *Kittens Game* that automates the production of [Manuscripts]( {{< relref "resource/manuscript.md" >}}), helping the player overcome a significant mid-game resource bottleneck.

### Unlocking and Functionality

1.  **Prerequisite:** The Printing Press upgrade is tied to the [Machinery]( {{< relref "science/machinery.md" >}}) technology. Machinery is unlocked after researching Writing, and costs 15,000 Science.
2.  **Building Integration:** The Printing Press is specifically used in conjunction with the [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}) building. Steamworks, which consume Coal and provide Energy, can automatically print Manuscripts after this upgrade is acquired.
3.  **Production Rate:** The Steamworks start producing Manuscripts at a rate of **0.0025 manuscripts/sec** with the Printing Press upgrade.

### Strategic Importance

The Printing Press is a crucial step in resolving the mid-game Manuscript bottleneck, which gates progression to advanced technologies like Theology and Astronomy.

*   **Manuscript Generation:** Prior to automation, Manuscripts must be manually crafted using scarce resources (Parchment from Furs, acquired through Hunting, and Culture from Amphitheatres/Temples). The Printing Press provides an automated source of Manuscripts, converting the high-cost materials (Coal, Iron, Blueprints) required for Steamworks into sustained cultural output.
*   **Technological Progression:** While acquiring the necessary materials—including [Blueprints]( {{< relref "resource/Blueprint.md" >}}) and [Gears]( {{< relref "craft/Gear.md" >}}) (which require Steel)—to build Steamworks can present its own hurdle, establishing automated Manuscript production allows the player to bypass the tedious and slow process of manual crafting.
*   **Challenge Mode:** The Printing Press is particularly critical in the **Pacifism Challenge**, where **Hunting** is unavailable. Since Hunting is the primary source of Furs (needed to craft Parchment), and therefore Manuscripts, the Pacifism Challenge dictates that the player *must* rely on Mints (to generate Furs/Ivory) and the [Printing Press]( {{< relref "upgrade/Printing_Press.md" >}}) to get the required Manuscripts for progression.

### Further Upgrades

The effectiveness of the Printing Press can be significantly improved by later technologies:

*   [Offset Press:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Offset_Press.md" >}}) This upgrade (unlocked by Combustion) is **four times as effective**, raising Steamworks output to **0.01 manuscripts/sec**.
*   [Photolithography:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Photolithography.md" >}}) This further upgrade (unlocked by Satellites) increases the printing effectiveness again, raising the rate to **0.04 manuscripts/sec**.
