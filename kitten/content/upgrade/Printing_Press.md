Uranium, a critical resource in the later stages of the game, is primarily acquired through three methods: trading with the Dragons, production via upgraded Quarries, and refinement using Accelerators.

Here is a breakdown of what produces or provides Uranium:

### 1. Production via Buildings and Upgrades

Uranium can be produced directly using advanced buildings and upgrades:

*   **Quarry (with Orbital Geodesy):** Quarries will provide a small amount of uranium once the **Orbital Geodesy** upgrade is purchased [1, 2]. Quarries produce uranium at a rate of **0.0005 per tick** [2].
    *   **Orbital Geodesy** requires **Satellites** technology and costs 150,000 Science, 1,000 Alloy, and 35,000 Oil [2].
*   **Accelerator:** This building refines **titanium into uranium** [1]. Accelerators produce **0.0025 uranium per tick** (or 0.0125 per second) [3, 4].
    *   The Accelerator building is unlocked by researching the **Particle Physics** science [3, 5]. It costs 7,500 Titanium, 125 Concrete, and 25 Uranium [3].
*   **Planet Cracker:** Uranium is produced by the **Planet Cracker** structure [1, 6]. This structure's output is affected by the **Dune** cycle, which can increase its uranium output by **+10%** [7].
*   **Reactor (Consumption Reduction):** While Reactors consume Uranium [8], the **Enriched Uranium** upgrade reduces this consumption by **25%** and also provides a **+25% uranium production bonus** that applies only to Quarries [9].

### 2. Acquisition via Trade

The most straightforward way to initially acquire Uranium is through trade:

*   **Dragons:** Uranium can be **bought** from the **Dragons** civilization, in exchange for Titanium [1].
    *   Dragons sell **1 Uranium** and the trade has a 95% chance of success (reaching 100% chance with 6 Embassy levels) [10, 11].
    *   Dragons are unlocked after researching **Nuclear Fission** [12].

### 3. Production Boosts

Uranium production can be boosted by:

*   **Cycles (Dune):** The **Dune** cycle doubles Uranium income when the **Numerology** metaphysics upgrade is researched [7].
*   **Enriched Uranium:** This Workshop upgrade increases Uranium production by **+25%** (but only applies to Quarries) [9].
*   **Planet Busters:** This upgrade doubles the output of the Planet Cracker structure [13].

Uranium is an important resource, particularly in the later stages of the game, as it is needed to refine **Unobtainium** via a Lunar Outpost [1, 4].
