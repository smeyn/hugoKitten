[Pneumatic Press]( {{< relref "upgrade/Pneumatic_Press.md" >}}) is a workshop upgrade that enhances the automation capabilities of [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}). It is unlocked by researching the [Physics]( {{< relref "techs/Physics.md" >}}) technology and requires **20,000 Science, 30 Gears, and 5 Blueprints** to purchase.

### **Mechanical Effects**
The upgrade functions as an extension of the [Workshop Automation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Workshop_Automation.md" >}}) system. Once enacted, it provides the following benefits:
*   **Plate Automation:** Steamworks will automatically convert a portion of your **iron** into [plates]( {{< relref "resource/plate.md" >}}) whenever iron reaches **98% of its maximum storage capacity**.
*   **Conversion Rate:** The amount of iron converted into plates is determined by the number of active Steamworks, following the formula: **(2 + 2 * [Number of Steamworks])%** of the total resource.
*   **Operational Requirements:** This automation only triggers when Steamworks are active and powered. 

### **Prerequisites and Context**
To access the Pneumatic Press, you must first navigate the mid-game technology tree:
1.  [Machinery:]( {{< relref "science/machinery.md" >}}) Required to build Steamworks and unlock the initial [Workshop Automation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Workshop_Automation.md" >}}) upgrade.
2.  [Physics:]( {{< relref "techs/Physics.md" >}}) The direct prerequisite technology for the Pneumatic Press.
3.  [Workshop Automation:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Workshop_Automation.md" >}}) The Pneumatic Press is a secondary upgrade in this chain; the base upgrade must be purchased first to enable the conversion of wood to beams and minerals to slabs.

### **Strategic Utility**
The Pneumatic Press is designed to mitigate resource wastage during long idle periods or when **iron production** exceeds its relatively low terrestrial storage caps. By automatically converting excess iron into plates, the upgrade ensures that production does not halt at the cap and provides a passive income of a critical craftable resource used extensively for **Harbours, Factories, and Reactors**. This is particularly valuable before reaching the **Space Era**, where iron becomes a primary trade resource for obtaining titanium.
