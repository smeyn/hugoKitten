The [Reinforced Saw]( {{< relref "reinforced_saw.md" >}}) is an upgrade available in the [Workshop]( {{< relref "workshop.md" >}}) tab of *Kittens Game*, specifically designed to improve wood production.

Here is a breakdown of the upgrade:

### Function and Effect

The Reinforced Saw improves the efficiency of your [Lumber Mills]( {{< relref "buildings/Lumber_Mill.md" >}}):

*   **Effect:** It increases the efficiency of each Lumber Mill by an **additional +20%** (`lumberMillRatio`).
*   **Context:** Improving wood output is strategically important because wood accumulates slowly, especially in the early game, until you invest in Lumber Mills.

### Requirements and Cost

To purchase the Reinforced Saw, you must have researched the necessary technology and accumulated the required resources:

*   **Prerequisite:** The technology [Construction]( {{< relref "construction.md" >}}) must be researched to unlock this upgrade.
*   **Cost:** The upgrade costs **2,500 Science** and **1,000 Iron**.

### Progression

The Reinforced Saw is part of a progression of workshop upgrades aimed at boosting Lumber Mill efficiency:

1.  [Reinforced Saw:]( {{< relref "reinforced_saw.md" >}}) +20% efficiency per Lumber Mill (requires Construction).
2.  [Steel Saw:]( {{< relref "steel_saw.md" >}}) +20% efficiency per Lumber Mill (requires Physics and Steel Saw).
3.  [Titanium Saw:]( {{< relref "titanium_saw.md" >}}) +15% efficiency per Lumber Mill (requires Titanium Saw).
4.  [Alloy Saw:]( {{< relref "alloy_saw.md" >}}) +15% efficiency per Lumber Mill (requires Titanium Saw).

Construction, the prerequisite technology, is unlocked after researching [Animal Husbandry]( {{< relref "animal_husbandry.md" >}}). Lumber Mills themselves are structures unlocked by Construction. Lumber Mills are often necessary because Wood accumulates "reeeaallyyyy slowlyyyy" until they are built, which requires Iron.
