The **Reinforced Saw** is an upgrade available in the **Workshop** tab of *Kittens Game*, specifically designed to improve wood production.

Here is a breakdown of the upgrade:

### Function and Effect

The Reinforced Saw improves the efficiency of your **Lumber Mills**:

*   **Effect:** It increases the efficiency of each Lumber Mill by an **additional +20%** (`lumberMillRatio`).
*   **Context:** Improving wood output is strategically important because wood accumulates slowly, especially in the early game, until you invest in Lumber Mills.

### Requirements and Cost

To purchase the Reinforced Saw, you must have researched the necessary technology and accumulated the required resources:

*   **Prerequisite:** The technology **Construction** must be researched to unlock this upgrade.
*   **Cost:** The upgrade costs **2,500 Science** and **1,000 Iron**.

### Progression

The Reinforced Saw is part of a progression of workshop upgrades aimed at boosting Lumber Mill efficiency:

1.  **Reinforced Saw:** +20% efficiency per Lumber Mill (requires Construction).
2.  **Steel Saw:** +20% efficiency per Lumber Mill (requires Physics and Steel Saw).
3.  **Titanium Saw:** +15% efficiency per Lumber Mill (requires Titanium Saw).
4.  **Alloy Saw:** +15% efficiency per Lumber Mill (requires Titanium Saw).

Construction, the prerequisite technology, is unlocked after researching **Animal Husbandry**. Lumber Mills themselves are structures unlocked by Construction. Lumber Mills are often necessary because Wood accumulates "reeeaallyyyy slowlyyyy" until they are built, which requires Iron.
