[Void Aspiration]( {{< relref "upgrade/Void_Aspiration.md" >}}) is a late-game **workshop upgrade** that becomes available after researching the [Void Space]( {{< relref "techs/Void_Space.md" >}}) technology. Enacting this upgrade requires a specific investment of **15 Time Crystals and 2,000 Antimatter**.

The primary function of Void Aspiration is to serve as a prerequisite for two advanced structures: **Void Hoovers and Void Rifts**. Once this upgrade is secured, the following structures can be developed to enhance resource management during the endgame:

*   **Void Hoover:** These structures increase the maximum amount of **void** that may be gained during a **Temporal Paradox** day by **1 unit**.
*   **Void Rift:** Each rift increases the **global resource storage ratio by 2%**. Additionally, they provide a **10% boost to the energy production of HR Harvesters**, which operate on Hawking Radiation from black holes.

Void Aspiration is a critical step in the **Chrono-Optimization phase** of development. By unlocking Void Rifts, players can stack storage bonuses additively with **Event Horizons**, allowing them to overcome the terrestrial storage caps that otherwise bottleneck late-game progression. Accessing these structures is necessary for players aiming to establish **self-sustaining resource loops** through high-count **Chronosphere resets**.
