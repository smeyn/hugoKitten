[Storage Bunkers]( {{< relref "upgrade/Storage_Bunkers.md" >}}) is a late-game **workshop upgrade** that significantly expands your terrestrial storage capacity. It requires an investment of **25,000 Science, 500 Unobtainium, and 1,250 Concrete**. To access this upgrade, you must first research the [Exogeology]( {{< relref "resource/exogeology.md" >}}) technology.

### **Mechanical Effects and Resource Scaling**
The primary function of Storage Bunkers is to increase the maximum storage capacity of specific buildings by **20%**. This percentage-based bonus applies to the following structures:
*   [Barns]( {{< relref "buildings/Barn.md" >}})
*   [Warehouses]( {{< relref "buildings/Warehouse.md" >}})
*   [Harbours]( {{< relref "buildings/Harbour.md" >}})
*   [Mints]( {{< relref "buildings/Mint.md" >}}) (specifically for gold storage)

The resources that receive this 20% capacity boost include **wood, minerals, coal, iron, gold, and titanium**. Because the bonus is multiplicative with the base storage of these buildings, it scales effectively as you construct more infrastructure.

### **Strategic Utility**
Storage Bunkers are considered a vital upgrade for transitioning into the **Eludium and Space eras**. Progression often halts when the cost of new buildings or space missions exceeds your maximum storage limits; this upgrade helps push through those "caps" without requiring the construction of a prohibitive number of new buildings. 

Strategic advice suggests purchasing Storage Bunkers as soon as you reach the **500 Unobtainium** threshold. Expanding storage for metals like [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) is particularly important for reaching the 125,000 cap needed for [Space Manufacturing]( {{< relref "upgrade/Space_Manufacturing.md" >}}), which allows your factories to boost the production of space-based structures. Additionally, the increase to gold storage helps in the construction of [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}) and the advancement of religious upgrades.
