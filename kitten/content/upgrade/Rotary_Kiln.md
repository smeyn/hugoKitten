[Rotary Kiln]( {{< relref "upgrade/Rotary_Kiln.md" >}}) is a mid-to-late-game **workshop upgrade** that significantly enhances the resource output of [Calciners]( {{< relref "buildings/Calciner.md" >}}),. It is a critical component for automating the production of metals required for advanced industrial and space-based infrastructure,.

### **Unlocking and Costs**
To access the Rotary Kiln upgrade, you must first research the [Robotics]( {{< relref "techs/Robotics.md" >}}) technology,. The upgrade requires the following resources:
*   **145,000 Science**
*   **5,000 Titanium**
*   **500 Gears**

### **Mechanical Effects**
Once purchased, Rotary Kiln applies a percentage-based bonus to the base production rates of every active Calciner:
*   **Iron Production:** Increased by **+75%**,.
*   **Titanium Production:** Increased by **+225%** (effectively making Calciners three times more effective at generating titanium),.

### **Strategic Utility and Context**
In the progression of *Kittens Game*, Calciners serve as an essential industrial engine that consumes minerals and oil to passively generate iron and titanium,. Rotary Kiln is the second major efficiency upgrade in the Calciner chain, positioned between [Oxidation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Oxidation.md" >}}) (+95% iron, +285% titanium) and [Fluidized Reactors]( {{< relref "upgrade/Fluidized_Reactors.md" >}}) (+100% iron, +300% titanium).

The massive **+225% boost to titanium** is particularly vital during the "Titanium Era" and early "Space Era". During these phases, titanium is a primary bottleneck for building **Ships, Observatories, and Moon Missions**,,. While trading with Zebras is the initial method for acquiring titanium, upgrades like Rotary Kiln allow Calciners to provide a reliable, automated income of the metal, reducing the reliance on manual trading and catpower expenditure,,.

Furthermore, because Calciners also produce iron, this upgrade supports the production of [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) through the [Steel Plants]( {{< relref "upgrade/Steel_Plants.md" >}}) upgrade, which automatically converts a portion of a Calciner's iron output into steel,. This creates a synergistic loop where Rotary Kiln improves iron throughput, which in turn increases the passive generation of steel for advanced components like **Gears and Alloy**,,.
