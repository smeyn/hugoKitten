The term "Workshop Automation" refers to a specific **Workshop upgrade** associated with the [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}) building in *Kittens Game*.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Workshop Automation upgrade:

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** This upgrade is unlocked by researching the [Machinery]( {{< relref "science/machinery.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Cost:** To acquire Workshop Automation, you must spend **10,000 Science** and **25 Gears**.
*   **Effect/Function:** Once purchased, the upgrade converts small quantities of craftable resources into materials when they are near their storage limit.
    *   Specifically, [Workshop Automation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Workshop_Automation.md" >}}) converts **2% plus 2% times the number of Steamworks** of wood into **beams** and minerals into **slabs** when that resource is at **98% of its storage cap**.
    *   This conversion occurs **once per year** (i.e., in the Spring season).
    *   The goal of this automation is to help players manage their storage capacity by automatically converting common, capped resources (Wood and Minerals) into more advanced materials (Beams and Slabs).
*   **Advanced Form:** There is a subsequent upgrade, [Advanced Automation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Advanced_Automation.md" >}}), which causes Workshop Automation to be triggered **twice per year**.
*   **Related Upgrade:** The [Pneumatic Press]( {{< relref "upgrade/Pneumatic_Press.md" >}}) upgrade further enhances this function by enabling Workshop Automation to also convert **Iron into Plates**.

In essence, Workshop Automation allows your Steamworks to passively manage resource bottlenecks, ensuring that your basic resources (Wood and Minerals) continue to generate useful craftable materials even when they are approaching their storage limits. This is particularly handy for generating Beams and Slabs without requiring constant manual crafting.
