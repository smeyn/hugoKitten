The [Zebra Workshop]( {{< relref "zebra_workshop.md" >}}) is one of the specialized buildings associated with the Zebra civilization in *Kittens Game*. It is unlocked early in the game's technological progression, alongside the Zebra Outpost and Zebra Forge.

Here is a detailed summary of the Zebra Workshop's characteristics and purpose:

### Construction and Unlocks

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** Like the other Zebra buildings, the Zebra Workshop is unlocked by researching the [Archery]( {{< relref "archery.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Cost:** It requires **5 Bloodstone** to construct.
*   **Price Ratio:** The building has a price ratio of 1.15.

### Purpose and Effects

The Zebra Workshop serves to enhance your civilization's maximum capacity for catpower and, most notably, unlocks further enhancements related to the Zebras themselves:

*   **Catpower Capacity:** It increases your maximum Catpower by **+10**.
*   **Zebra Upgrades:** Its primary function is that it **Unlocks Zebra Upgrades** in the Workshop tab.

The Zebra Workshop is the middle tier of the three initial Zebra buildings, costing more Bloodstone than the Zebra Outpost (1 Bloodstone) but significantly less than the Zebra Forge (50 Bloodstone).
