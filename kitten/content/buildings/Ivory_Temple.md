The [Ivory Temple]( {{< relref "buildings/Ivory_Temple.md" >}}) is a specialized building available in *Kittens Game*, particularly associated with the zebra race and the conversion of advanced hunting resources.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Ivory Temple:

### Building Details and Cost

*   **Resource Cost:** The Ivory Temple requires **1 T-Mythril** and **100 Ivory**.
*   **Price Ratio:** It has a price ratio of 1.15.
*   **Prerequisite:** The Ivory Temple is listed as a building unlocked via **Zebra Upgrades**, meaning you need to build the [Zebra Workshop]( {{< relref "buildings/Zebra_Workshop.md" >}}) and [Zebra Forge]( {{< relref "buildings/Zebra_Forge.md" >}}) first, which are unlocked by [Archery]( {{< relref "techs/Archery.md" >}}) and cost Bloodstone.

### Primary Function and Effects

The main function of the Ivory Temple is to convert large amounts of the rare resource **Ivory** into **Minerals**.

*   **Conversion:** It **converts ivory to minerals**.
*   **Resource Rates:** It consumes **100 Ivory per tick** and produces **1 Mineral per tick**.
*   **Catpower:** It also increases maximum Catpower storage by **+10**.

### Upgrades and Automation

The functionality of the Ivory Temple can be significantly boosted through late-game religious upgrades, specifically those related to the "Whispers" religion path (though not explicitly detailed in the provided sources, the automation is listed under its effects):

*   **Whispers Unlock:** The "Whispers" religion unlocks automation for the Ivory Temple.
*   **Automation Effect:** When automation is enabled, the Temple **doubles ivory consumption and minerals production**.
*   **Drawbacks (Automation):** The automation process comes with small associated costs: **-2 Titanium per tick** and **-0.00002 Alicorns per tick**.
*   **Bonus Production (Automation):** Automation also yields a slight production of another resource: **+0.00005 T-Mythril per tick**.

### Context in the Game

The Ivory Temple provides a mechanism to monetize the rare resource Ivory, which is typically acquired through **Hunting**. Hunting is unlocked by [Archery]( {{< relref "techs/Archery.md" >}}), costs 100 Catpower per hunt, and has a chance to yield Ivory, Furs, and Unicorns. Ivory itself is classified as a rare resource that gives +10% happiness but is gradually consumed.

The Ivory Temple offers a way to convert this consumable rare resource into a common resource (Minerals) at a high volume, which is particularly useful in scenarios where mineral supply is a bottleneck, or when accumulating high levels of Ivory from consistent hunting or Mint production.
