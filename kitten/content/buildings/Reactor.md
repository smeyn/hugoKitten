The **Reactor** is a late-mid-game industrial structure in *Kittens Game* that is crucial for generating significant amounts of energy and enabling progression into the space and unobtainium era.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the Reactor:

### 1. Unlocking and Construction

The Reactor building is unlocked by researching **Nuclear Fission** technology.

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** Nuclear Fission.
*   **Base Cost:** 3,500 Titanium, 5,000 Plate, 50 Concrete, and 25 Blueprint.
*   **Price Ratio:** 1.15.

### 2. Purpose and Effects

The Reactor is primarily used for large-scale power generation and resource management of highly processed materials:

*   **Energy Generation:** Produces a substantial **+10 Energy** per tick.
*   **Production Boost:** Provides a **+5% Global Production** bonus.
*   **Uranium Management:** It consumes **-0.001 Uranium per Tick** and increases your **Max Uranium storage by +250**.
*   **Strategic Role:** Reactors are categorized as supplemental production-boosting buildings that cost hard-to-acquire blueprints. They are necessary to increase Uranium storage, which is required for obtaining Unobtainium. The Reactor is also listed as one of the required energy production buildings to complete the **Energy Challenge**.

### 3. Key Upgrades and Synergies

Reactors benefit from several dedicated Workshop upgrades, enhancing their power output and leveraging them to boost other systems:

| Upgrade/Policy | Effect | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cold Fusion** | Increases Reactor energy output by **+2.5** (+25%). | |
| **Thorium Reactors** | Increases Reactor energy output by **+0.25** (+25%) but introduces a consumption of **-0.25 Thorium/tick per reactor**. | |
| **Enriched Uranium** | Reduces the Reactor's uranium consumption by **25%**. | |
| **Reactor Vessel** | Allows upgraded trade ships to increase Harbor capacity by **+5% per active Reactor** beyond the base capacity limit. | |
| **Nuclear Plants** | Increases the steel produced by **Steel Plants** (a Calciner upgrade) by an additional **2% per active Reactor**. | |

The *IW 40K Endless Run Guide* specifically advises that Reactors provide a lot of power, but due to their blueprint cost, players should consider **turning off Thorium Reactors** unless they are time skipping for antimatter.

The Reactor building is a prerequisite for buying the **Lunar Outpost**, which is necessary for converting Uranium into Unobtainium.
