The [Hut]( {{< relref "buildings/Hut.md" >}}) is the foundational housing building in the early stages of *Kittens Game*, enabling population growth and expanding your basic resources.

Here is a comprehensive overview of the Hut, its purpose, cost, and strategic role:

### 1. Function and Effect

Huts are essential for early progression as they directly increase the capacity for your workforce.

*   **Population:** Each Hut increases the maximum number of Kittens your village can support by **+2**.
*   **Catpower Storage:** Each Hut increases your maximum **Catpower** capacity by **+75**. Catpower is generated by Hunters and is used for trade and acquiring rare resources like Furs and Ivory.

### 2. Acquisition and Cost

Huts are one of the first structures a player builds after establishing basic resource production.

*   **Resource Cost:** Constructing a Hut requires **5 Wood**.
*   **Price Ratio:** Huts have a price ratio of 2.5.
*   **Unlocking Kittens:** Purchasing the first Hut unlocks **Kittens** and the Village tab, allowing you to assign jobs like Woodcutter.
*   **Initial Build Order:** A player must first accumulate 10 Catnip to build Catnip Fields, then refine 100 Catnip into 1 Wood (doing this five times) before they can purchase the first Hut.

### 3. Strategic Importance (Early Game)

Huts are a critical component for early resource scaling:

*   **Global Modifier:** In the early game, **population is THE global modifier** for production. Therefore, experts strongly recommend keeping Huts (and subsequent Log Houses) **maxed out whenever possible** to maximize population.
*   **Catnip Management:** Because each Kitten consumes Catnip (4.25 units per second), players should not buy too many Huts until they have a balanced Catnip supply, especially considering the severe production decrease during **Winter** (-75%).
*   **Housing Progression:** Huts are the initial form of housing and are superseded by [Log Houses]( {{< relref "buildings/Log_House.md" >}}) (unlocked by [Construction]( {{< relref "techs/Construction.md" >}})) and later [Mansions]( {{< relref "buildings/Mansion.md" >}}) (unlocked by [Architecture]( {{< relref "techs/Architecture.md" >}})).

### 4. Upgrades and Price Reduction

The cost efficiency of Huts can be permanently improved through various Workshop upgrades, which reduce their price ratio:

| Upgrade | Price Ratio Reduction | Prerequisite |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Ironwood Huts]( {{< relref "upgrade/Ironwood_Huts.md" >}}) | -50% | Reinforced Warehouses |
| [Concrete Huts]( {{< relref "upgrade/Concrete_Huts.md" >}}) | -30% | Concrete Pillars |
| [Unobtainium Huts]( {{< relref "upgrade/Unobtainium_Huts.md" >}}) | -25% | Exogeology |
| [Eludium Huts]( {{< relref "upgrade/Eludium_Huts.md" >}}) | -10% | Advanced Exogeology/Exometallurgy |

These price ratio reductions, along with other Metaphysics bonuses like [Paragon]( {{< relref "resource/paragon.md" >}}), are essential for allowing players to continue maxing out Huts as their wood reserves and costs escalate.
