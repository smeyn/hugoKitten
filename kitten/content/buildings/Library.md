The [Library]( {{< relref "buildings/Library.md" >}}) is a foundational early-game building in *Kittens Game* that is essential for unlocking scientific progression and accessing the core mechanics of the game.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Library:

### 1. Unlocking and Cost

*   **Prerequisite:** The Library is unlocked once you have accumulated **25 Wood**.
*   **Resource Cost:** Building a Library requires **25 Wood**.
*   **Price Ratio:** The Library has a price ratio of 1.15.

### 2. Primary Effects

The Library is critical because it unlocks the mechanism for generating and storing [Science]( {{< relref "resource/science.md" >}}).

*   **Science Production:** Each Library provides a **+10% Science** boost.
*   **Science Storage:** Each Library increases the maximum Science storage capacity by **+250**. The initial capacity for Science is 250 units.
*   **Culture Storage:** Each Library also provides **+10** to maximum Culture capacity.
*   **Kitten Job:** Creating a Library unlocks the [Scholar]( {{< relref "job/Scholar.md" >}}) job, which allows you to employ Kittens in harvesting Science. Scholars produce 0.035 Science per tick.
*   **Astronomical Events:** After building your first Library, there is a **0.25% chance every day** that an **astronomical event** will occur, which, when observed, earns Science.

### 3. Strategic Role in Early Progression

In the early game, purchasing Libraries is a critical step in achieving scientific velocity.

*   **Science Rush:** Experts recommend that players prioritize converting accumulated wood into **Libraries before Barns**.
*   **Accelerated Tech:** Libraries are essential because they immediately increase science storage, enabling the rapid accumulation necessary to cross crucial technological thresholds in a shorter time span. Having more Libraries increases the science gained from observing astronomical events.
*   **Iron Will Mode:** In Iron Will mode (playing without kittens/housing), the Library is crucial as astronomical events observed after building Libraries become the **only initial source of Science**. Players in this mode are advised to concentrate on building nothing but Libraries until they have researched Calendar, Agriculture, and Archery.

### 4. Upgrades and Progression

The Library is an early building that can be upgraded later in the game:

*   **Upgrade Path:** The Library upgrades to a [Data Center]( {{< relref "buildings/Data_Center.md" >}}). This upgrade is unlocked by researching [Electronics]( {{< relref "techs/Electronics.md" >}}).
*   **Data Center Conversion:** Data Centers are generally superior to Libraries, providing **+750** max Science and **+250** max Culture. However, if you are planning to upgrade, be aware that astronomical events cease to occur if you have zero Libraries and zero Data Centers. Additionally, switching to Data Centers will **decrease your bonus for crafting blueprints** since you will have fewer total buildings compared to Libraries.
*   **Science Cap Boosts:** Libraries' maximum science bonus increases by **2% per Observatory** if you have researched upgrades like [Titanium Reflectors]( {{< relref "upgrade/Titanium_Reflectors.md" >}}), [Unobtainium Reflectors]( {{< relref "upgrade/Unobtainium_Reflectors.md" >}}), or [Eludium Reflectors]( {{< relref "upgrade/Eludium_Reflectors.md" >}}).

Libraries are classified as structures that increase maximum storage, and experts emphasize that increasing resource storage limits (or "caps") is the second most important thing in the game, right after production.
