The [Warehouse]( {{< relref "warehouse.md" >}}) is an essential resource storage building in *Kittens Game*, unlocked in the mid-early game, which helps address the fundamental bottleneck of resource caps.

Here is a detailed summary of the Warehouse, based on the sources:

### 1. Construction and Unlocks

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** The Warehouse building is unlocked by researching the [Construction]( {{< relref "construction.md" >}}) technology. Construction costs 1,300 Science.
*   **Cost:** The base cost to construct a Warehouse is **1.5 Beam** and **2 Slab**. These materials are crafted resources, requiring Wood and Minerals.
*   **Upgrade Path:** The Warehouse is an upgradeable building, designed to eventually be replaced by the **Spaceport**.

### 2. Purpose and Storage Effects

Warehouses increase the storage capacity for common and processed resources:

| Resource | Maximum Storage Increase per Warehouse |
| :--- | :--- |
| Wood | +150 |
| Minerals | +200 |
| Iron | +25 |
| Coal | +30 |
| Gold | +5 |
| Titanium | +10 |

A key upgrade, [Silos]( {{< relref "silos.md" >}}), also allows Warehouses to store **Catnip**, adding **+750 Max Catnip** per Warehouse.

### 3. Strategic Importance and Progression

The Warehouse is strategically vital for alleviating resource storage limits, which the sources note is the second most important thing in the game, as hitting storage limits greatly slows progress.

*   **Mid-Game Building:** Warehouses, along with Barns and Harbors, are categorized as general storage buildings that should be built "as needed".
*   **Filling Gaps:** When grinding for specific resources in the mid-game, if other production buildings (Mines, Smelters, Log Houses, Workshops) are capped, players are advised to **build Warehouses**.
*   **Early Game Strategy:** While [Barns]( {{< relref "buildings/Barn.md" >}}) are unlocked earlier (via Agriculture), Warehouses are the next step in storage capacity after Barns are introduced.

### 4. Key Upgrades

Warehouses benefit from numerous Workshop upgrades that increase their storage capacity, often stacking additively with other storage buildings like Barns and Harbors:

| Upgrade Name | Effect on Storage Capacity | Technology/Prerequisite |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Reinforced Warehouses]( {{< relref "reinforced_warehouses.md" >}}) | Max storage for common resources (Wood, Minerals, Coal, Iron, Gold, Titanium) is increased by **25%**. | Steel |
| [Titanium Warehouses]( {{< relref "titanium_warehouses.md" >}}) | Max storage for common resources is increased by **50%**. | Silos |
| [Alloy Warehouses]( {{< relref "alloy_warehouses.md" >}}) | Max storage for common resources is increased by **45%**. | Chemistry |
| [Concrete Warehouses]( {{< relref "concrete_warehouses.md" >}}) | Max storage for common resources is increased by **35%**. | Concrete Pillars |
| [Storage Bunkers]( {{< relref "storage_bunkers.md" >}}) | Max storage for common resources is increased by **20%**. | Exogeology |
| [Concrete Pillars]( {{< relref "concrete_pillars.md" >}}) | Increases Max storage for Wood, Minerals, Iron, Coal, Gold, and Titanium by **5%**. | Mechanization |

Warehouses can also benefit from upgrades that apply to all storage facilities (Barns, Warehouses, Harbors, and Mints), such as those relating to Reinforced Barns, Titanium Barns, and Alloy Barns, which increase Wood, Minerals, and Iron storage capacity.
