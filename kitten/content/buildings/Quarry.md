The **Calciner** (sometimes referred to as Calcinator) is an advanced industrial building in *Kittens Game* that specializes in resource conversion, primarily producing refined Iron and Titanium. It is unlocked during the mid-game industrial phase.

### Construction and Function

The Calciner is a building used for advanced resource refinement, producing output that is categorized as "Conversion production".

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** The Calciner is unlocked by researching the **Chemistry** technology.
*   **Cost:** Building a Calciner requires a significant investment in processed resources: **100 Steel, 15 Titanium, 1 Blueprint, and 500 Oil**.
*   **Energy and Pollution:** It consumes **1 Energy** per tick to operate. Like other industrial buildings such as the Smelter and Steamworks, the Calciner produces **pollution**.

### Resource Conversion Details

The Calciner converts common resources into crucial metals:

| Input (Consumption) | Output (Production) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **-1.5 Minerals per Tick** | **+0.15 Iron per Tick** |
| **-0.024 Oil per Tick** | **+0.0005 Titanium per Tick** |

### Upgrades and Enhancements

The Calciner's efficiency can be dramatically increased through various Workshop upgrades:

| Upgrade Name | Production Boost | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Oxidation** | +95% Iron, +285% Titanium | Unlocked by Metallurgy. |
| **Rotary Kiln** | +75% Iron, +225% Titanium | Unlocked by Robotics. |
| **Fluidized Reactors** | +100% Iron, +300% Titanium | Unlocked by Nanotechnology. |

Additionally, the Calciner can be upgraded to integrate with Steel production:

*   **Steel Plants:** This upgrade converts 10% of the Calciner's Iron output into Steel (at a 100:1 ratio), although this decreases the final Iron output by 10%.
*   **Automated Plants:** Boosts the steel produced by Steel Plants by **25%** of the general craft ratio.
*   **Nuclear Plants:** Provides an additional **2% boost** to Steel Plants production per active Reactor.
*   **Griffin Relations: Metallurgists:** This policy increases the Calciner's steel production bonus by **+15%**.

### Strategic Context

1.  **Industrial Foundation:** Calciners are listed among the production-boosting buildings (alongside Steamworks, Magnetos, and Reactors) that cost blueprints and should be purchased provided the player has the resources, as they "help a lot in creating the base resources".
2.  **Policy Synergy:** The **Autocracy** government policy provides a bonus (0.4% per leader rank per uncapped population building) to all Conversion production, which includes the Calciner's output.
3.  **Challenge Alterations:** In the **Black Sky Challenge** (where astronomical events and thus Starcharts/Blueprints are disabled), the initial cost of Calciners is altered to make them obtainable, ensuring progression is still possible without relying on Starcharts.
