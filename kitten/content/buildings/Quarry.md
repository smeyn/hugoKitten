The [Quarry]( {{< relref "buildings/Quarry.md" >}}) is a bonfire building unlocked by the [Geology]( {{< relref "techs/Geology.md" >}}) technology. It is a mid-to-late-game structure primarily used to enhance mineral output and automate the production of coal and uranium.

### **Construction and Base Effects**
*   **Cost:** Initial construction requires **50 Scaffolds**, **125 Steel**, and **1,000 Slabs**.
*   **Price Ratio:** 1.15.
*   **Mineral Bonus:** Each Quarry provides a flat **+35% bonus** to mineral production.
*   [Coal Production:]( {{< relref "resource/coal_production.md" >}}) It generates **+0.015 coal per tick** (0.075 per second). This makes it a significant source of passive coal alongside Smelters and Mines.

### **Environmental Impact**
Quarries are listed as industrial structures that contribute to **pollution**. High levels of pollution can eventually reduce catnip production, kitten happiness, and arrival speeds.

### **Workshop Upgrades and Uranium**
Quarries are essential for the transition into the space era through two specific workshop upgrades:
*   [Orbital Geodesy:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Orbital_Geodesy.md" >}}) Unlocked by Satellites, this upgrade allows Quarries to produce [uranium]( {{< relref "resource/uranium.md" >}}) at a base rate of **0.0005 per tick**. This is a critical alternative for gathering uranium without trading titanium to Dragons.
*   [Enriched Uranium:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Enriched_Uranium.md" >}}) This upgrade provides a **+25% bonus** specifically to the uranium production rate of Quarries.

### **Policy Interactions**
The effectiveness of Quarries can be modified by foreign relations policies:
*   **Naga Relations: Masons:** This policy provides a **+2.5% bonus to slab crafting** when using Quarries. This is unlocked by reaching Naga Embassy level 20 and owning the Diplomacy metaphysics upgrade.

### **Strategic Utility**
Quarries are considered a "supplemental production building" necessary to push past resource bottlenecks. They are particularly useful for automating materials needed for [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}), [Gears]( {{< relref "craft/Gear.md" >}}), and **Nuclear Reactors**. In the deep endgame, maintaining high production from Quarries supports the **uranium supply** required for Lunar Outposts and Planet Crackers.
