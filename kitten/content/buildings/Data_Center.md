A **Data Centre** is a high-tier scientific building that serves as the direct **upgrade to the Library**. It provides significantly enhanced storage for science and culture, and it is a critical component for reaching the massive science caps required for late-game progression.

### **Acquisition and Costs**
*   **Unlocking:** You must research [Electronics]( {{< relref "techs/Electronics.md" >}}) (135k Science, 70 Blueprints) to enable the option to upgrade Libraries into Data Centres.
*   **Cost:** Each Data Centre costs **10 Concrete and 100 Steel**.
*   **Energy Requirement:** Unlike Libraries, which are energy-neutral, each Data Centre **consumes 2 Watts** of energy.

### **Primary Effects and Benefits**
Once a Library is upgraded, the resulting Data Centre provides the following bonuses:
*   **Science Production:** Grants a **+10% bonus** to overall science production.
*   **Science Storage:** Increases the **maximum science cap by 750**.
*   **Culture Storage:** Increases the **maximum culture cap by 250**.
*   **Compendium Efficiency:** Provides a **+1,000 increase to the Compendium Cap**, allowing you to store more science via crafted compendiums.

### **Workshop Upgrades and Synergies**
Data Centres can be made exponentially more powerful through specific Workshop research:
*   [Cryocomputing:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Cryocomputing.md" >}}) This upgrade (from Superconductors) **reduces energy consumption by 50%**, bringing the drain down from 2 Watts to **1 Watt** per building.
*   [Uplink:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Uplink.md" >}}) Creates a synergy with Bio Labs, increasing the science and culture caps of Data Centres by **+1% per Bio Lab** owned.
*   **Reflectors (Titanium, Unobtainium, and Eludium):** These upgrades allow your **Observatories** to boost the effectiveness of Data Centres. Each built Observatory provides an additive **+2% bonus** to the Data Centre’s science capacity.
*   [Machine Learning:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Machine_Learning.md" >}}) This Artificial Intelligence upgrade increases the effectiveness of Data Centres by **+10% for every AI Core** built.
*   [Starlink:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Starlink.md" >}}) Further enhances the Uplink synergy by providing additional bonuses to science caps.

### **Strategic Utility**
*   **Efficiency Scaling:** One Data Centre provides the **same maximum science as three Libraries**. This makes them highly space-efficient for players struggling to hit the science requirements for advanced technologies like [Chronophysics]( {{< relref "techs/Chronophysics.md" >}}).
*   **The "Dead Stop" Warning:** You should never upgrade your last Library if you do not have the materials (Concrete and Steel) to immediately build a Data Centre. If you have **zero Libraries and zero Data Centres**, **astronomical events will cease to occur**, halting your supply of starcharts.
*   **Blueprint Crafting:** Be aware that switching to Data Centres may initially **decrease your bonus for crafting blueprints** if you end up with fewer total buildings than you had as Libraries. This can be mitigated through the [CAD System]( {{< relref "upgrade/CAD_System.md" >}}) upgrade, which applies a +1% craft ratio per scientific building.
*   **Energy Management:** Because they consume energy, mass-upgrading Libraries into Data Centres can quickly crash your power grid. It is often wise to wait until your energy production (via Magnetos or Reactors) is stable before performing a bulk upgrade.
