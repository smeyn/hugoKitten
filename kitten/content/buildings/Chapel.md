The [Chapel]( {{< relref "chapel.md" >}}) is a key structure in *Kittens Game*, categorized as a [Culture]( {{< relref "culture.md" >}}) building, that significantly boosts both your society's culture and faith accumulation.

### Unlocks and Construction

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** The Chapel is unlocked by researching the [Acoustics]( {{< relref "acoustics.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Acoustics Cost:** Researching Acoustics requires **60,000 Science** and **60 Compendium**.
*   **Base Cost:** The construction of a single Chapel requires a substantial investment in resources: **2000 Minerals**, **250 Culture**, and **250 Parchment**. It has a price ratio of 1.15.

### Primary Functions and Effects

The Chapel is crucial for advancing the cultural and religious aspects of your village:

1.  **Culture Production and Capacity:**
    *   It generates **+0.05 Culture per Tick**. Culture is a special resource generated by Amphitheatres, Temples, and Chapels, which is necessary for crafting Manuscripts.
    *   It increases your **Max Culture by +200**.

2.  **Faith Production:**
    *   The Chapel generates **+0.005 Faith per Tick**. This high rate makes the Chapel a major source of Faith.
    *   Faith is an expendable resource used exclusively in the Religion tab to purchase religious upgrades and is generated by Temples, Priests, and Chapels (once [Acoustics]( {{< relref "acoustics.md" >}}) is researched).

The technology that unlocks the Chapel, [Acoustics]( {{< relref "acoustics.md" >}}), is noted specifically for improving both **faith and culture production**.
