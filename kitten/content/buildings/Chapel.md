The **Chapel** is a key structure in *Kittens Game*, categorized as a **Culture** building, that significantly boosts both your society's culture and faith accumulation.

### Unlocks and Construction

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** The Chapel is unlocked by researching the **Acoustics** technology.
*   **Acoustics Cost:** Researching Acoustics requires **60,000 Science** and **60 Compendium**.
*   **Base Cost:** The construction of a single Chapel requires a substantial investment in resources: **2000 Minerals**, **250 Culture**, and **250 Parchment**. It has a price ratio of 1.15.

### Primary Functions and Effects

The Chapel is crucial for advancing the cultural and religious aspects of your village:

1.  **Culture Production and Capacity:**
    *   It generates **+0.05 Culture per Tick**. Culture is a special resource generated by Amphitheatres, Temples, and Chapels, which is necessary for crafting Manuscripts.
    *   It increases your **Max Culture by +200**.

2.  **Faith Production:**
    *   The Chapel generates **+0.005 Faith per Tick**. This high rate makes the Chapel a major source of Faith.
    *   Faith is an expendable resource used exclusively in the Religion tab to purchase religious upgrades and is generated by Temples, Priests, and Chapels (once Acoustics is researched).

The technology that unlocks the Chapel, Acoustics, is noted specifically for improving both **faith and culture production**.
