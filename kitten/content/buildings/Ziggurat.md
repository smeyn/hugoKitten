+++

The [Ziggurat]( {{< relref "ziggurat.md" >}}) is a major structure in *Kittens Game*, classified as a **Mega Structure**. It is crucial for initiating the production chain of unicorn-related resources and advancing through the later religious tiers of the game.

### 1. Unlocks and Construction

The Ziggurat building is unlocked relatively early by researching the [Construction]( {{< relref "construction.md" >}}) technology. However, it requires highly processed and rare resources to build.

| Detail | Cost/Requirement | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Technology Prerequisite** | [Construction]( {{< relref "construction.md" >}}) | |
| **Base Cost** | **50 Megalith, 50 Scaffold, and 1 Blueprint** | |
| **Visibility Requirement** | Players usually need approximately **5 Megaliths, 5 Scaffolds, and 1 Blueprint** before the building becomes visible in the Bonfire tab. | |
| **Price Ratio** | 1.25 | |

### 2. Core Function: Unicorn Sacrifice

The Ziggurat's most important function is enabling the conversion of Unicorns into **Unicorn Tears**.

*   **Sacrifice Unicorns:** Once you have a Ziggurat, you unlock the ability to **Sacrifice Unicorns** in the Religion tab.
*   **Cost and Yield:** Each sacrifice costs **2500 Unicorns**. In return, you **receive one Unicorn Tear for every Ziggurat you have**.
*   **Initial Benefit:** The resulting Unicorn Tear provides a **happiness/production bonus**.

### 3. Strategic Importance

The Ziggurat is the entry point to the "Unicorn/Time Crystal Era".

*   **Culture Boost:** The Ziggurat provides a passive effect of **Max Culture +8%**.
*   **Resource Pipeline:** The Ziggurat establishes the beginning of a crucial late-game resource line: **unicorns → tears → Black Liquid Sorrow (BLS) → alicorns → time crystals → relics**.
*   **Building Priority (Early Game):** Expert advice suggests that if a player needs to ask if they should get Ziggurats, they "probably don't need more than one" on their first few runs, due to the expensive nature of the entire resource line. It is advised to build one Ziggurat when possible, sacrificing unicorns for one tear for the initial bonus, as you "won’t need more than one tear until you hit the unicorn era".
*   **Building Priority (Late Game):** In the Unicorn Era, players are advised to **build a large number of ziggurats**. For the **IW 40K endless run**, it is suggested to build at least **10 Ziggurats** before converting unicorns, with **25–30** Ziggurats being the practical maximum due to resource costs.

### 4. Upgrades and Synergies

The Ziggurat interacts with other buildings and Policy/:

*   **Religious Synergy (Nagas):** The **Naga Relations: Cultists** policy (a Foreign policy) allows Ziggurats to **gain 10% of the bonuses The Order of the Sun grants to temples**.
*   **Culture Capacity (Unicorn Graveyard):** The [Unicorn Graveyard]( {{< relref "unicorn_graveyard.md" >}}) building (unlocked by Megalomania/Black Codex) increases your culture maximum by **+1% per Ziggurat**.
*   **Unicorn Rift Bonus:** The amount of unicorns gained from a **Unicorn Rift** (a random event unlocked by Ivory Towers) is boosted, calculated as **500 * (1 + your unicorn ziggurat bonus production to unicorns/10)**.
