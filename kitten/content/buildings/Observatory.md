The [Observatory]( {{< relref "observatory.md" >}}) is a key mid-game science building in *Kittens Game*, primarily designed to boost science accumulation, increase science capacity, and, most importantly, enable and enhance the discovery of **Starcharts**.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Observatory:

### 1. Construction and Unlocks

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** The Observatory is unlocked by researching [Astronomy]( {{< relref "astronomy.md" >}}). Astronomy requires 28,000 Science and 65 Manuscripts.
*   **Cost:** The base cost to construct an Observatory is **50 Scaffold, 35 Slab, 750 Iron, and 1,000 Science**.
*   **Price Ratio:** The price ratio of the Observatory is 1.1.

### 2. Purpose and Effects

The Observatory provides several critical functions related to science and celestial mechanics:

*   **Science and Capacity:** It provides a **+25% bonus to Science production** and increases the **Max Science cap by +1000**.
*   **Astronomical Events:** It is essential for managing Starchart acquisition:
    *   It increases the **Astronomical Event Chance by +0.2%** (additive).
    *   It increases the **Automatic Event Observation Chance by +1%**.
    *   Every Observatory built increases the daily chance of an astronomical event occurring (base chance is 0.25%).

### 3. Strategic Importance (The Titanium Era)

The Observatory is a high-priority building during the mid-game (referred to as the "Titanium era") because it is the primary bottleneck-breaker for unlocking trade with Zebras and acquiring titanium.

*   **Starchart Production:** Observatories are necessary for producing Starcharts. Starcharts are required to craft [Trade Ships]( {{< relref "craft/Trade_Ship.md" >}}), which are needed to discover Zebras.
*   **Iron Priority:** In the Titanium era, players are advised that **all Iron should be going towards Observatories**.
*   **Automation:** The increase in **Automatic Event Observation Chance** is crucial because it reduces the player's need to manually click the "Observe" button whenever an astronomical event occurs. The game suggests paying attention and clicking every meteor until you have 25 Starcharts, after which the Observatory's automatic observation chance helps significantly.
*   **Alternative Science Generation:** In the early stages of the **Iron Will** challenge, where housing cannot be built and kitten jobs are unavailable, the science gained from astronomical events (which are boosted by Observatories) is the *only* initial source of Science.

### 4. Upgrades and Synergies

Observatories benefit from and contribute to other systems via upgrades:

*   **Science Storage Boosts:** Observatories contribute directly to the effectiveness of your Library and later [Data Center]( {{< relref "data_center.md" >}}) buildings through specialized Reflectors:
    *   **Titanium Reflectors, Unobtainium Reflectors, and Eludium Reflectors** each increase the Libraries' (and Data Centers') max science bonus by an additional **2% per Observatory**.
    *   The [Astrolabe]( {{< relref "astrolabe.md" >}}) upgrade boosts the Observatory's science storage capacity by 50%.
*   **Event Chance Metaphysics:** The Metaphysics upgrade **Astromancy** doubles the Observatory's effectiveness regarding event chance and auto-event observation chance (though not the science bonus itself).
*   **Satellite Synergy:** The [Militarize Space]( {{< relref "militarize_space.md" >}}) policy increases the Observatory's maximum science bonus from Satellites by 10%. Additionally, the [Uplink]( {{< relref "uplink.md" >}}) and [Starlink]( {{< relref "starlink.md" >}}) upgrades, which boost Data Centers and Bio Labs, respectively, are unlocked by Satellites, further highlighting the interconnected nature of late-game science buildings.
