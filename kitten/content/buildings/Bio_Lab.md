The **Bio Lab** is an advanced mid-to-late-game science building in *Kittens Game*, primarily designed to significantly boost science capacity and production, and to introduce the ability to refine Catnip into **Oil**.

### Unlocking and Construction

The Bio Lab building is unlocked after significant investment in the Science tree:

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** The Bio Lab is unlocked by researching **Biology**. Biology is unlocked by Geology.
*   **Base Cost:** Construction requires a combination of processed materials and science: **100 Slab, 25 Alloy, and 1,500 Science**.
*   **Price Ratio:** The building has a price ratio of 1.1.

### Core Effects

The Bio Lab provides major boosts to your research capabilities:

*   **Science Production:** Provides a **+35% bonus to Science** production.
*   **Science Capacity:** Increases your **Max Science cap by +1,500**.
*   **Catnip Refinement:** Provides a **+10% Catnip refinement** bonus.

### Strategic Context

The Bio Lab is strategically important but carries a heavy upfront cost:

*   **Science Scaling:** Bio Labs are listed as buildings that increase science cap, helping players reach high science limits needed for advanced technology.
*   **Late-Game Utility:** To reach the 125K science limit required for Concrete Huts, players are advised to consider researching Biology to unlock Bio Labs, as they increase science and help "reduce the need to build so many observatories/temples (which start getting very costly)".
*   **Expense:** However, Bio Labs are noted to be "really expensive on your first couple runs," and new players may want to "feel free to skip it first time around". In later runs, they may still be skipped if high Paragon levels already provide a sufficient storage boost.
*   **Pollution:** Bio Labs are one of the many industrial buildings that produce **Pollution**.

### Key Upgrades and Synergies

The Bio Lab's function shifts significantly through specific upgrades, allowing it to become an oil production facility and synergizing with other science structures:

#### A. Oil Conversion Upgrades

The following upgrades allow the Bio Lab to convert food resources into Oil, requiring energy:

1.  **Biofuel Processing (Unlocked by Biochemistry):** This upgrade causes Bio Labs to consume **5 Catnip per second** (or 1 Catnip per tick) and consume **1 Energy** per tick. In return, it produces **0.10 Oil per second** (or 0.02 Oil per tick). Additionally, it grants a **+35% Science** bonus.
2.  **GM Catnip (Unlocked by Genetics):** This upgrade improves the Bio Lab's oil yield by **+60%** (multiplicative with other effects), although it does not affect the amount of Catnip consumed.
3.  **Shark Relations: Botanists Policy:** This foreign policy reduces the Bio Lab's energy consumption by **75%**.

#### B. Science and Data Center Synergy

Bio Labs interact closely with the late-game Data Center building, which is an upgrade to the Library:

1.  **Uplink (Unlocked by Satellites):** This upgrade creates a reciprocal bonus: Data Centers gain a **+1% bonus to Max Science, Max Culture, and Compendium Cap per Bio Lab**, and Bio Labs gain a **+1% Max Science bonus per Data Center**.
2.  **Starlink (Unlocked by Orbital Engineering):** Further increases the **Max Science bonus of Bio Labs by +1% per Data Center**.
3.  **CAD System (Unlocked by Electronics):** Bio Labs are one of the specific scientific buildings (along with Libraries/Data Centers, Academies, and Observatories) that improve the effectiveness of **Blueprint crafting** via the CAD System workshop upgrade. Bio Labs contribute this bonus even when they are turned off.

The Bio Lab thus facilitates the transition into the oil and advanced science era, often being built primarily for its energy-efficient method of converting excess catnip into valuable oil resources.
