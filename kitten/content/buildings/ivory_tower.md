The [Ivory Tower]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Ivory_Tower.md" >}}) is an advanced religious building within the Unicorn progression pathway that helps establish the production of unicorns and associated resources needed for late-game advancement.

Here is a detailed summary of the Ivory Tower:

### Building Details and Effects

| Category | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | 25 Tears and 25,000 Ivory [1]. |
| **Prerequisite** | You must complete at least one [Unicorn Tomb]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Unicorn_Tomb.md" >}}) before you can build an Ivory Tower [1]. |
| **Unicorn Generation** | It improves unicorn generation by **10%** [1]. |
| **Alicorn/Time Crystal Progression** | The Ivory Tower unlocks the **Unicorn Rifts** random event, which generates unicorns [1]. Each Ivory Tower increases the frequency of this event by 0.05% per game-day (or 1% per day per 20 towers) [1]. It also provides a boost to your unicorn rift amount equal to 10% of your unicorn ziggurat bonus to unicorn production [1]. |

### Strategic Context

The Ivory Tower is a key step in the religious pathway focused on Unicorns and Time Crystals (Phase 2 progression) [1, 2]:

1.  **Religious Hierarchy:** The Ivory Tower is the prerequisite structure that leads to the construction of the [Ivory Citadel]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Ivory_Citadel.md" >}}) [3].
2.  **Unicorn Resource Chain:** The primary religious path involves obtaining Unicorns (often initially through Hunting) [4, 5] and then sacrificing them in a Ziggurat to produce [Tears]( {{< relref "resource/tears.md" >}}) [1, 6, 7]. These Tears are then used along with Ivory to construct the Ivory Tower [1]. This process is crucial because it ultimately leads to the production of [Alicorns]( {{< relref "resource/alicorn.md" >}}), which are refined into [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}) [6, 8].
3.  **Efficiency in Specialized Runs:** In long runs, such as the Iron Will 40K challenge, players focus on building the unicorn production chain for resources like Ivory, which is then traded for minerals with the Nagas [9, 10]. The unicorn resources produced by Ivory Towers (Unicorns via Rifts) and the subsequent Ivory Citadels (Ivory via Meteors) are often prioritized as a passive, AFK source of these luxury goods [11].
