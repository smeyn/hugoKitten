The [AI Core]( {{< relref "ai_core.md" >}}) is a crucial **Mega Structure** building associated with late-game progression, particularly concerning energy consumption and the introduction of the advanced science mechanic known as **Gigaflops**.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the AI Core:

### 1. Construction and Core Function

The AI Core is a building that is unlocked during the late game, after significant technological investment.

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** The AI Core is unlocked by researching the [Artificial Intelligence]( {{< relref "artificial_intelligence.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Cost:** The base cost to construct an AI Core is **125 Antimatter** and **500,000 Science**.
*   **Energy Consumption:** AI Cores consume energy, and their consumption increases with the number of Cores built. The formula is **-(2 + 1.5 \* AI Core)** Energy per tick.
*   **Output:** The primary output of the AI Core is **+0.02 Gigaflops per Tick**.

### 2. Strategic Role and Mechanics

The AI Core is central to the very late-game progression involving high-level technology and the risk of the "AI Apocalypse".

*   **Gigaflops Generation:** AI Cores are the sole source of **Gigaflops**. Gigaflops contribute to the **hashrate level**, which increases the relic production of **Space Beacons** that have been upgraded with [Relic Stations]( {{< relref "upgrade/Relic_Station.md" >}}).
*   **AI Apocalypse Risk:** Accumulating Gigaflops can potentially lead to the **AI Apocalypse**. If the AI level reaches 15, you start losing resources.
*   **Synergy with Entanglement Stations:** AI Cores are typically built alongside **Entanglement Stations** (unlocked by Quantum Cryptography), which produce **Hashes**. The combination of AI Cores and Entanglement Stations creates hashes, which increase the hashrate level.
*   **Ratio Management:** When building AI Cores and Entanglement Stations, players must monitor the Gigaflops accumulation to avoid the AI Apocalypse. The ratio is suggested to be roughly **5 AI Cores to 1 Entanglement Station** to prevent excessive Gigaflops accumulation, especially since Gigaflops are always lost on reset.

### 3. Upgrades and Policy Synergies

The effectiveness of AI Cores can be enhanced through specific Workshop upgrades and Government Policy/:

*   [Machine Learning:]( {{< relref "machine_learning.md" >}}) This Workshop upgrade makes [Data Center]( {{< relref "data_center.md" >}}) effectiveness increase by **+10% per AI Core**. The effect is based on the *number* of AI Cores built, not the AI level.
*   [AI Bases:]( {{< relref "ai_bases.md" >}}) This Workshop upgrade increases **Moon Base storage by +10% per AI Core**. The effect is also based on the number of AI Cores.
*   **Transkittenism Policy:** This late-game government policy makes AI Cores twice as effective. The AI Cores produce **twice as many Gigaflops**, and the policy ensures that the **AI apocalypse will not occur**. Furthermore, [AI Bases]( {{< relref "ai_bases.md" >}}) and the [Machine Learning]( {{< relref "machine_learning.md" >}}) upgrades are strengthened.
*   **Anarchy Challenge Goal:** Interestingly, the [AI Core]( {{< relref "ai_core.md" >}}) is specified as the building that must be built to complete the **Anarchy** challenge.
