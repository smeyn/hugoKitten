The [Workshop]( {{< relref "workshop.md" >}}) is a fundamental game interface tab that becomes available fairly early in the game and serves two crucial, interconnected functions: purchasing **Upgrades** and **Crafting** resources.

### 1. Unlocks and Access

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** The Workshop building itself is unlocked by researching the [Mining]( {{< relref "mining.md" >}}) technology.
*   [Construction:]( {{< relref "construction.md" >}}) The Workshop building costs **100 Wood** and **400 Minerals**.
*   **Base Effect:** Each Workshop built provides a base **+6% bonus to Crafting** efficiency.
*   **Timing:** Players receive the option to create Workshops shortly after unlocking Lumber Mills, Mines, and Amphitheatres.

### 2. Primary Functions of the Workshop Tab

The Workshop tab contains three main sections:

#### A. Upgrades
This section allows players to purchase upgrades that are essential for improving overall village productivity, resource efficiency, and kitten functionality.

*   **Purpose:** Upgrades generally improve the efficiency of buildings or workers, which is highly beneficial in the long run.
*   **Examples:** Upgrades unlocked here include [Reinforced Saw]( {{< relref "reinforced_saw.md" >}}) (Lumber Mill efficiency), [Gold Ore]( {{< relref "gold_ore.md" >}}) (Smelters produce gold), [Composite Bow]( {{< relref "composite_bow.md" >}}) (Hunter catpower boost), and [Caravanserai]( {{< relref "caravanserai.md" >}}) (Trade relations boost).

#### B. Crafting
This section allows for the creation of composite materials necessary for advanced buildings and subsequent technological progression.

*   **Purpose:** Crafted items are generally composite parts for buildings, and advanced structures require a fair amount of crafting to complete.
*   **Craftable Resources:** The Workshop is used to convert basic resources into crucial craftable resources like **Beam**, **Slab**, [Plate]( {{< relref "resource/plate.md" >}}), [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/steel.md" >}}), and later, [Manuscript]( {{< relref "resource/manuscript.md" >}}), [Compendium]( {{< relref "compendium.md" >}}), and [Blueprint]( {{< relref "resource/Blueprint.md" >}}).
*   **Exchange:** The Workshop also allows you to exchange Catnip directly for basic resources.
*   **Automation:** The [Engineer]( {{< relref "engineer.md" >}}) job, enabled by [Mechanization]( {{< relref "mechanization.md" >}}) technology, allows kittens to automate crafting within the Workshop.

#### C. Zebra Upgrades
This section houses upgrades that become available once the [Zebra Workshop]( {{< relref "zebra_workshop.md" >}}) building is constructed.

### 3. Strategic Importance of the Workshop

*   **Resource Management:** The Workshop allows for quick/mass purchases of any items you have crafted at least once.
*   **Bottleneck Breaking:** Upgrades unlocked via the Workshop are vital for efficiency. For example, some useful early upgrades require **Iron**, and expert advice recommends pushing to get a Workshop early to acquire these initial economic boosts.
*   **Blueprint Conversion:** The Workshop is where advanced science resources are created, such as [Blueprints]( {{< relref "resource/Blueprint.md" >}}) (crafted from Compendiums), which are required for late-game technology and structures like Steamworks.
*   **Crafting Ratio:** The crafting bonus provided by the Workshop can be further enhanced by other buildings, such as the [Factory]( {{< relref "factory.md" >}}), which provides an additional crafting bonus. The [Full Industrialization]( {{< relref "full_industrialization.md" >}}) policy also slightly improves the crafting bonus each factory provides.

The Workshop is the central hub for optimizing and processing resources, moving your civilization past the initial gathering phase and into complex industrialization.
