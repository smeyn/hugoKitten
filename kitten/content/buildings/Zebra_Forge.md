The [Zebra Forge]( {{< relref "zebra_forge.md" >}}) is a specialized building associated with the Zebra civilization in *Kittens Game*. Its primary purpose is to **unlock advanced crafting** of resources specific to the Zebras and their materials.

Here is a breakdown of the Zebra Forge's characteristics, cost, and function:

### 1. Construction and Unlocks

*   **Location:** The Zebra Forge is listed under the "Zebras" category of buildings.
*   **Cost:** It requires **50 Bloodstone** to construct.
*   **Prerequisite:** The building is unlocked by researching the [Archery]( {{< relref "archery.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Secondary Effect:** Building the Zebra Forge provides a permanent increase to your maximum Catpower by **+50**.

### 2. Primary Function: Advanced Crafting

The most critical function of the Zebra Forge is enabling the crafting of two specialized resources:

1.  [Bloodstone:]( {{< relref "bloodstone.md" >}}) The Forge unlocks the ability to craft [Bloodstone]( {{< relref "bloodstone.md" >}}) itself. Bloodstone is a unique resource required for Zebra buildings (like the Forge itself and the Zebra Outpost/Workshop) and is crafted from **Time Crystal** (5k) and [Relic]( {{< relref "relic.md" >}}) (10k).
2.  [T-Mythril:]( {{< relref "t-mythril.md" >}}) The Forge also unlocks the crafting of [T-Mythril]( {{< relref "t-mythril.md" >}}) (Titanium-Mythril). T-Mythril is crafted from **5 Bloodstone, 1,000 Ivory, and 500 Titanium**.

### 3. Strategic Context

The Zebra Forge (along with the Zebra Outpost and Zebra Workshop) is part of a progression path aimed at leveraging the Zebra civilization:

*   **Bloodstone Acquisition:** In the standard game, [Bloodstone]( {{< relref "bloodstone.md" >}}) is a rare resource that has a 0.05% chance of being acquired through Hunting if you have at least 10 Zebras in Iron Will mode. Unlocking the Forge and the ability to craft Bloodstone allows for a reliable production method, though the required materials (Time Crystals and Relics) indicate this is a very late-game industrial capability.
*   **T-Mythril Use:** T-Mythril, unlocked by the Forge, is required to construct the [Ivory Temple]( {{< relref "ivory_temple.md" >}}).

### Progression of Zebra Buildings

The Zebra buildings typically follow a cost hierarchy based on Bloodstone:

1.  [Zebra Outpost:]( {{< relref "zebra_outpost.md" >}}) 1 Bloodstone.
2.  [Zebra Workshop:]( {{< relref "zebra_workshop.md" >}}) 5 Bloodstone; unlocks Zebra Upgrades.
3.  [Zebra Forge:]( {{< relref "zebra_forge.md" >}}) 50 Bloodstone; unlocks advanced crafting.
