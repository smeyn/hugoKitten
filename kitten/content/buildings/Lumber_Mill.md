The [Lumber Mill]( {{< relref "lumber_mill.md" >}}) is a crucial early-to-mid-game building in *Kittens Game*, primarily focused on significantly increasing your Wood output and efficiency.

Here is a comprehensive overview of the Lumber Mill, drawing on the provided sources:

### 1. Construction and Unlocks

*   **Prerequisite:** The Lumber Mill building is unlocked by researching the [Construction]( {{< relref "construction.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Cost:** The base cost to construct a Lumber Mill is **100 Wood, 50 Iron, and 250 Minerals**.
*   **Context:** The walkthrough notes that Wood accumulates "reeeaallyyyy slowlyyyy" until you invest in Lumber Mills. To construct them, you must first research [Metal Working]( {{< relref "metal_working.md" >}}) to gain access to [Smelters]( {{< relref "buildings/Smelter.md" >}}), which produce the necessary **Iron**.

### 2. Purpose and Effects

The Lumber Mill serves two primary functions:

1.  **Wood Production Boost:** It increases your Wood production by **+10%**.
2.  **Catnip Refinement Efficiency:** It increases the **Catnip Refinement** rate by **+10%**.

### 3. Upgrades and Enhancements

The efficiency of Lumber Mills can be improved through several Workshop upgrades, which stack multiplicatively with the base production:

| Upgrade Name | Cost | Prerequisite Tech | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Reinforced Saw]( {{< relref "reinforced_saw.md" >}}) | Science, Iron (2,500/1,000) | Construction | Each Lumber Mill gives an additional **+20%** to the production ratio. |
| [Steel Saw]( {{< relref "steel_saw.md" >}}) | Science, Steel (52K/750) | Physics | Each Lumber Mill gives an additional **+20%** to the production ratio. |
| [Titanium Saw]( {{< relref "titanium_saw.md" >}}) | Science, Titanium (70K/500) | Steel Saw | Each Lumber Mill gives an additional **+15%** to the production ratio. |
| [Alloy Saw]( {{< relref "alloy_saw.md" >}}) | Science, Alloy (85K/75) | Titanium Saw | Each Lumber Mill gives an additional **+15%** to the production ratio. |

### 4. Strategic Role

Lumber Mills are strategically important for several reasons in the early and mid-game:

*   **Early Iron Management:** In the early game, before later technologies are available, Lumber Mills are recommended as a way to **use up excess Iron**.
*   **Wood Bottleneck Solution:** They are necessary to increase Wood output to a sustainable rate, which supports the construction of other early buildings like Barns, Huts, and Libraries.
*   **Iron Will Mode:** In the **Iron Will** challenge, where you cannot build housing, the Lumber Mill's Catnip Refinement bonus is particularly important as the [Clear Cutting]( {{< relref "clear_cutting.md" >}}) policy provides a similar bonus.

The priority placed on building Lumber Mills is highlighted by the advice to hold off on building steel until the Coal upgrades are secured, noting that players are going to need the Iron for [Lumber Mills]( {{< relref "buildings/Lumber_Mill.md" >}}) and Observatories.
