The **Solar Farm** is an advanced building in *Kittens Game* that serves as an environmentally friendly source of energy. It is categorized as an **Upgraded Building** that replaces an existing food production structure.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the Solar Farm:

### 1. Unlocks and Construction

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** The Solar Farm is unlocked by researching **Ecology**.
*   **Cost:** The base cost for construction is **250 Titanium**, with a price ratio of 1.15.
*   **Upgrade Path:** The Solar Farm is an upgrade of the **Pasture** building, meaning that existing Pastures can be converted to Solar Farms. This choice, however, results in the loss of the Pasture's catnip food bonus.

### 2. Purpose and Effects

The primary purpose of the Solar Farm is energy generation, with its output fluctuating based on the game's seasons:

*   **Base Energy Output:** It provides **+2 Energy**.
*   **Seasonal Fluctuations:**
    *   In **Summer**, the Solar Farm produces **+2.67 Energy**.
    *   In **Winter**, the production drops to **+1.5 Energy**.
    *   The **Quantum Dot Cells** upgrade also adds a **+30%** production bonus in Spring and Autumn.

### 3. Upgrades and Enhancements

The energy output of Solar Farms can be significantly boosted through several workshop upgrades:

| Upgrade Name | Technology Prerequisite | Effect | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Photovoltaic Cells** | Nanotechnology | Increases Solar Farm energy production by **+50%**. | |
| **Thin Film Cells** | Satellites | Increases Solar Farm energy production by **+15% in Winter**. | |
| **Quantum Dot Cells** | Thorium | Increases Solar Farm energy production by **+15% in Winter** (additive with Thin Film Cells) and **+30% in Spring and Autumn**. | |

### 4. Strategic Context

The decision to build or upgrade to Solar Farms is a strategic choice regarding resource priority:

*   **Energy vs. Food:** You should only upgrade from a Pasture to a Solar Farm "When you need **Energy more than you need catnip**". The upgrade is considered "much safer" than upgrading Aqueducts to Hydro Plants, because the demand reduction provided by Pastures inherently has strict diminishing returns.
*   **Challenges:** The Solar Farm is a required building for the **Energy Challenge**, which necessitates building at least one of every energy production building. Furthermore, the **Winter Has Come** challenge grants an increasing reward that boosts the effect of **Summer** on Solar Farms by 5% per run (capped at 200%).
*   **Pollution Mitigation:** Solar Farms are considered an **environmentally friendly energy source**, which can help mitigate the negative effects of pollution.
