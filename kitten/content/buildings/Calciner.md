The [Calciner]( {{< relref "calciner.md" >}}) is an industrial building in *Kittens Game* that plays a key role in mid-to-late game resource refinement, specifically concerning Iron and Titanium production.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the Calciner's purpose, costs, effects, and strategic importance, drawing on the sources:

### 1. Construction and Unlocks

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** The Calciner building is unlocked by researching the [Chemistry]( {{< relref "chemistry.md" >}}) technology. Chemistry is a late-Physics technology.
*   **Cost:** The base cost to construct a Calciner is **100 Steel, 15 Titanium, 1 Blueprint, and 500 Oil**.
*   [Energy:]( {{< relref "energy.md" >}}) It consumes **1 Energy** per tick to operate.

### 2. Purpose and Effects

The Calciner's primary function is advanced refinement, specifically converting minerals and oil into Iron and Titanium:

*   **Input Consumption:**
    *   It consumes **1.5 Minerals** per tick.
    *   It consumes **0.024 Oil** per tick.
*   **Output Production (Conversion Production):**
    *   It produces **0.15 Iron** per tick.
    *   It produces **0.0005 Titanium** per tick.

Calciners are one of the core buildings whose production counts as "Conversion production".

### 3. Upgrades and Enhancements

The efficiency of Calciners can be significantly boosted through Workshop upgrades, usually unlocked by Metallurgy and Nanotechnology:

| Upgrade Name | Effect | Prerequisite |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Oxidation]( {{< relref "oxidation.md" >}}) | Increases Iron production by **+95%** and Titanium production by **+285%**. | Metallurgy. |
| [Rotary Kiln]( {{< relref "rotary_kiln.md" >}}) | Increases Iron production by **+75%** and Titanium production by **+225%**. | Robotics. |
| [Fluidized Reactors]( {{< relref "fluidized_reactors.md" >}}) | Increases Iron production by **+100%** and Titanium production by **+300%**. | Nanotechnology. |
| [Steel Plants]( {{< relref "steel_plants.md" >}}) | Converts 10% of the Calciner's Iron output into Steel (100:1 ratio), decreasing the final Iron output by 10%. | Robotics. |
| [Automated Plants]( {{< relref "automated_plants.md" >}}) | Boosts the Steel production from Steel Plants by **25%** of the general craft ratio. | Steel Plants. |
| [Nuclear Plants]( {{< relref "nuclear_plants.md" >}}) | Boosts the Steel production from Steel Plants by an additional **2% per active Reactor**. | Automated Plants. |
| **Policy Bonus** | The [Autocracy]( {{< relref "autocracy.md" >}}) policy provides a bonus of 0.4% per leader rank per uncapped population building to all conversion production, which includes Calciners. | |
| **Policy Bonus** | The **Griffin Relations: Metallurgists** policy increases the Calciner's steel production bonus by **+15%**. | Griffin Embassy Level 20, Diplomacy metaphysics. |

### 4. Strategic Role and Recommendations

Calciners are a type of building that boosts general production but costs hard-to-acquire blueprints.

*   **Resource Focus:** They are one of the main ways to produce **Iron** and [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}).
*   **Mid-Game Investment:** In the *Pre Titanium era notes*, it is advised that players should consider purchasing production-boosting buildings that cost blueprints, such as Calciners, Steamworks, Magnetos, and Reactors, as this "will help a lot in creating the base resources".
*   **Black Sky Challenge:** In the **Black Sky Challenge**, where astronomical events (a source of Starcharts/Blueprints) do not occur, the initial cost of Calciners is altered to make them possible to obtain without relying on Starcharts.
*   **Pollution:** Calciners are among the buildings that produce pollution.
