The **Steamworks** is an essential industrial building in *Kittens Game* that introduces early automation, supplements energy production, and is crucial for overcoming the manuscript bottleneck in the mid-game.

### Unlocks, Cost, and Base Effects

The Steamworks building is unlocked by researching the **Machinery** technology, which costs 15,000 Science.

*   **Cost:** The base cost to construct a Steamworks is **65 Steel, 20 Gear, and 1 Blueprint**.
*   **Price Ratio:** The building has a high price ratio of 1.25.
*   **Base Effects:**
    *   **Energy:** Provides **+1 Energy**.
    *   **Coal:** Reduces Coal consumption by **80%**.
    *   **Production Boost:** Provides a **Magneto Boost of +15%**.
*   **Drawback:** Like other industrial buildings (Mines, Smelters, etc.), the Steamworks produces **Pollution**.

### Strategic Purpose: Automation and Manuscript Production

The primary strategic role of the Steamworks is to introduce automation and overcome resource bottlenecks:

1.  **Manuscript Automation:** Steamworks consume Coal to create a variety of handy items. Critically, once the **Printing Press** upgrade is researched, Steamworks automatically print **Manuscripts** at a base rate of 0.0025 manuscripts/sec. Manuscript production can be further boosted by the **Offset Press** and **Photolithography** upgrades, which each multiply production by a factor of 4. This automation is necessary for overcoming the steep requirements of the later **Theology** and **Astronomy** sciences.
2.  **Resource Conversion:** The **Workshop Automation** upgrade allows Steamworks to automatically convert a percentage of wood into beams and minerals into slabs once per year when those resources are nearly capped (at 98% of capacity). The **Advanced Automation** upgrade makes this process activate twice per year, and **Pneumatic Press** adds the conversion of iron to plates.
3.  **Industrial Foundation:** Steamworks are listed among the supplemental production-boosting buildings (alongside Magnetos, Reactors, Calciners, and Quarrys) that cost blueprints and help create base resources.

### Upgrades and Efficiency

Several upgrades directly affect the Steamworks' efficiency and resource consumption:

*   **Coal Efficiency:** The **High Pressure Engine** and **Fuel Injector** upgrades each reduce the Coal consumption of Steamworks by 20%.
*   **Magneto Synergy:** The Magneto Boost is further improved by the **Griffin Relations: Machinists** policy, which increases the Steamworks' Magneto boost bonus by +0.5%.

### Contextual Notes

*   **Prerequisite Grinding:** The Steamworks presents a hurdle because it requires **Blueprints** and **Gears** (which require Steel). In the IW 40K run, the Sharks and Griffins trading loop is cited as a key method for collecting the necessary steel, gears, and blueprints for Steamworks.
*   **Coal Management:** Since Steamworks consume coal, players are advised to **turn off Steamworks** when grinding coal for other priorities, such as building Oil Wells.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   The Steamworks is listed as a necessary building to complete the **Energy Challenge**.
    *   In the **Pacifism Challenge**, the cost of the Steamworks increases by 1.5, rounded down to the nearest integer, and the blueprint cost linearly increases by 5.
