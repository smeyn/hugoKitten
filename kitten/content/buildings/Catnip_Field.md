The [Catnip Field]( {{< relref "catnip_field.md" >}}) is the most foundational building in *Kittens Game*, enabling the automatic accumulation of food necessary for the survival and expansion of your civilization.

Here is a breakdown of the Catnip Field:

### Core Function and Cost

The Catnip Field is the initial food production building, crucial for transitioning the game from manual clicking to passive resource gain:

*   **Acquisition:** You begin by manually gathering Catnip until you accumulate 10 pieces.
*   **Base Cost:** The first Catnip Field costs **10 Catnip**.
*   **Price Ratio:** The price ratio for purchasing additional fields is **1.12**.
*   **Effect:** Each Catnip Field produces **+0.125 Catnip per Tick**.

### Strategic Importance

Building Catnip Fields is the first step in establishing a stable food supply, which is critical because every kitten consumes Catnip:

*   **Initial Progression:** Purchasing fields allows Catnip to accumulate on its own without requiring further manual clicking. Buying multiple fields early (up to 19 or 20) is advised to speed up progress.
*   **Basic Resource Rotation (BRR):** The earliest routine for building a strong economic foundation involves taking all kittens and making them farmers, and then **capping (or close to capping) everything that ONLY costs catnip**, which includes Catnip Fields.
*   **Diminishing Returns:** Eventually, the fields become too expensive and do not produce enough to be truly useful. At this stage, players are advised to research Engineering and build [Aqueducts]( {{< relref "buildings/Aqueduct.md" >}}) instead, which increase Catnip production by a percentile.
*   **Storage:** The default maximum storage capacity for Catnip is **5000**.

### Seasonal and Environmental Effects

Catnip Fields are highly susceptible to the game's weather system, especially during the harsh Winter season:

*   **Seasonal Fluctuations:** Production values change radically throughout the year.
    *   In **Spring**, production receives a hefty bonus (average +50%).
    *   In **Winter**, production sharply **nosedives** (average -75%).
    *   A **Cold Winter** can reduce Catnip production by **-90%**.
*   **Contrast with Farmers:** Unlike the Catnip accumulated by the [Farmer]( {{< relref "farmer.md" >}}) job (which produces +1 Catnip per tick), the production from Catnip Fields *is* subject to the effects of Winter. Juggling Catnip production is crucial for survival, particularly in Winter.

### Challenge and Policy Interactions

Catnip Fields are affected by specific late-game policies and challenges:

*   **Communism Policy:** This policy causes [Catnip Field]( {{< relref "catnip_field.md" >}}) production to become **-100% in cold winters**.
*   **Winter Has Come Challenge:** When this challenge (which imposes endless winter) is active, Catnip production from fields **will not benefit from the paragon production bonus**. The increasing reward for completing this challenge increases the effect of Spring on Catnip Fields by 5% per run.
*   **Post Apocalypse Challenge:** In this high-pollution scenario, [Catnip Fields]( {{< relref "buildings/Catnip_Field.md" >}}) may cost **unobtainium** at high pollution levels or with high numbers of broken cryochambers.

In the early game, managing Catnip production from these fields is like stocking a simple pantry: you have to gather enough food during the bounty of spring and summer to ensure you have reserves large enough to survive the consumption during winter's famine.
