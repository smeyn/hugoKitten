The [Magneto]( {{< relref "buildings/Magneto.md" >}}) is a crucial industrial building in *Kittens Game*, marking an advancement in your civilization's energy and production capabilities.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the Magneto's features, strategic role, and related concepts:

### Unlocking and Cost

*   **Technology Requirement:** The Magneto is unlocked by researching [Electricity]( {{< relref "techs/Electricity.md" >}}). Electricity requires 75,000 Science and 85 Compendiums.
*   **Resource Cost:** Building a Magneto is expensive, requiring advanced materials:
    *   [Alloy:]( {{< relref "craft/Alloy.md" >}}) 10 units
    *   [Gear:]( {{< relref "craft/Gear.md" >}}) 5 units
    *   [Blueprint:]( {{< relref "resource/Blueprint.md" >}}) 1 unit
*   **Price Ratio:** The Magneto has a price ratio of 1.25.

### Effects and Function

The Magneto serves two primary functions: generating energy and boosting global production.

1.  **Global Production Boost:** Magnetos provide a **+2% Global Production** bonus.
    *   This makes them highly desirable, as global modifiers are generally prioritized over specific resource upgrades for efficient scaling.
    *   In the strategic advice of the mid-game, Magnetos are among the general production-boosting items that "should be built provided you have the resources to use on them".
2.  **Energy Production:** Each Magneto provides **+5 Energy**.
3.  **Consumption:** Magnetos consume **-0.05 Oil per Tick**.

### Strategic Role and Integration

Magnetos are vital in the mid-to-late game for powering energy-intensive structures, often working in tandem with other industrial buildings.

*   **Energy Generation Focus:** Magnetos, along with Steamworks and Reactors, are listed as structures that increase production for resources. They provide necessary energy to ensure that other advanced buildings operate at full efficiency.
*   **Relationship with Steamworks:** Steamworks are industrial buildings that consume Coal and provide **+1 Energy** as well as a **Magneto Boost of +15%**. This suggests that Steamworks enhance the production effects of Magnetos.
    *   In the late game, the effectiveness of Magnetos is listed as one of the primary production boosts, alongside Reactor bonuses and the Solar Revolution bonus.
    *   The **Griffin Relations: Machinists** policy further improves this synergy, increasing the Steamwork's Magneto boost bonus by +0.5%.
*   **Energy/Pollution Policy Interaction:** The **Lizard Relations: Ecologists** policy can interact with Magnetos. Depending on how many [Hydro Plants]( {{< relref "buildings/Hydro_Plant.md" >}}) are active, some of your Magnetos will continue to boost resource production even if they are turned off.
*   **Endgame Context:** Once Magnetos come into play, the influence of population growth on global production becomes "very minor".

**In essence, the Magneto is a powerful scaling tool that uses high-tier crafting resources (Alloy, Gear, Blueprint) to provide clean energy and a straight global production multiplier, reinforcing the strategy of focusing on overall efficiency rather than singular resource production gains.**


The [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}) building primarily benefits the [Magneto]( {{< relref "buildings/Magneto.md" >}}) structure, as well as several other production-related processes through its upgrades and functionality.

Here is a breakdown of the buildings that benefit from Steamworks:

### 4. Magneto (Boosted Production)

The Magneto building receives a direct, inherent boost from the Steamworks.

*   **Magneto Boost:** Each Steamworks provides a **+15% Magneto Boost**. This increases the Magneto's effect of providing a **+2% Global Production** bonus.
*   **Policy Enhancement:** This Magneto boost provided by the Steamworks can be further improved by the **Griffin Relations: Machinists** policy, which increases the Steamwork's Magneto boost bonus by **+0.5%**.
