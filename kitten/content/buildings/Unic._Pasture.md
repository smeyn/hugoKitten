The **Unicorn Pasture** is an early-to-mid-game building in *Kittens Game* that plays a dual role: providing a perpetual source of the rare **Unicorn** resource, and offering a permanent quality-of-life improvement by reducing the Catnip consumed by your kittens.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the Unicorn Pasture:

### 1. Unlocks and Construction

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** The Unicorn Pasture is unlocked once you research **Animal Husbandry**.
*   **Discovery Method:** Unicorns, the primary resource required to build the pasture, have a small chance of appearing in the village each game day if you have less than 2. They are initially found via **Hunting**, which has a 5% chance of yielding one unicorn per hunt.
*   **Cost:** The base cost to build one Unicorn Pasture requires **2 Unicorns**.
*   **Price Ratio:** The building has a price ratio of 1.75.

### 2. Purpose and Effects

The Unicorn Pasture provides two critical functions:

*   **Unicorn Generation:** It produces **+0.001 Unicorns per Tick**. This establishes a self-sustaining source of unicorns, rather than relying solely on hunting.
*   **Catnip Demand Reduction:** It reduces the amount of Catnip consumed by each kitten by **-0.15%**. This is described as "Very handy in the long run" for managing your food supply.

### 3. Strategic Importance and Progression

The Unicorn Pasture is an early gateway into the complex **Unicorn/Religion Era** of the game:

*   **Early Hunting Goal:** The walkthrough advises that if you are lucky, hunting will yield unicorns, and once you "Find two Unicorns, you can create a Unicorn Pasture".
*   **Circular Function:** The pasture automatically generates more unicorns, allowing you to purchase more pastures, which, in turn, further reduces Catnip consumption. This is a beneficial "circular" process.
*   **Foundation for Unicorn Era:** Unicorn Pastures are the starting point for the entire unicorn resource production line, which eventually leads to **Tears**, **Black Liquid Sorrow (BLS)**, **Alicorns**, and **Time Crystals**.
*   **Upgrades:** Unicorn Pasture generation can be boosted by the **Unicorn Selection** workshop upgrade, which increases production by **+25%**.

### 4. Advanced Unicorn Buildings

Once the Unicorn Pasture is established, you can proceed with the religious path that utilizes Unicorns and Tears:

*   **Ziggurats:** Unicorns are required to build **Ziggurats** (unlocked by Construction). Ziggurats enable you to **Sacrifice Unicorns** (2500 Unicorns per sacrifice) to receive **Unicorn Tears**.
*   **Tears Consumption:** Tears are then used to purchase advanced Unicorn buildings that further boost unicorn generation, such as **Unicorn Tomb**, **Ivory Tower**, **Ivory Citadel**, **Sky Palace**, **Unicorn Utopia**, and **Sunspire**. These buildings are the key to the **Unicorn/Time Crystal Era**.

In essence, the Unicorn Pasture takes a rare, sporadic hunting bonus (the Unicorn) and turns it into a reliable, automated luxury resource, while simultaneously providing a permanent reduction in the cost of kitten maintenance.
