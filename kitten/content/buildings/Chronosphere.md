The **Chronosphere** is a crucial, high-tier **Mega Structure** in *Kittens Game*, unlocked late in the game's progression. It is central to managing resources across multiple runs and is key to accessing the very late-game phases of Time and Void mechanics.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the Chronosphere:

### 1. Unlocks and Construction

The Chronosphere is unlocked by researching **Chronophysics** and requires extremely rare resources to build:

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** **Chronophysics**. Chronophysics itself requires 250,000 Science and 5 Time Crystal.
*   **Base Cost:** 2,500 Unobtainium, 1 Time Crystal, 100 Blueprint, and 250,000 Science.
*   **Price Ratio:** 1.25.

### 2. Core Functions and Effects

The Chronosphere has several critical, interrelated functions that affect resource management and game mechanics:

*   **Resource Preservation on Reset:** Its main purpose is to preserve a percentage of your non-crafted, non-luxury resources upon resetting the game. Each Chronosphere preserves **1.5%** of these resources (Catnip, Wood, Minerals, Oil, Uranium, etc.).
    *   If the total preservation percentage exceeds 100%, you receive multiple units of those resources upon reset.
*   **Void Generation:** Chronospheres are necessary for generating **Void**. Void is a unique resource that is generated randomly every year change if you have Chronospheres.
*   **Energy Consumption:** It consumes **-20 Energy** per tick to operate.
*   **Temporal Flux Generation (Upgrade):** While the base function generates Temporal Flux at a rate of 5 units per minute when the game is not active, the **Chronosurge** upgrade causes each Chronosphere to generate **1 flux per year**.
*   **Temporal Paradox:** It has an associated risk: "Occasional Temporal Paradox".

### 3. Strategic Importance and Progression

The Chronosphere is strategically vital for transitioning into high-paragon, high-speed runs and the late-game resource cycles:

*   **Accelerating Future Runs (The Seed):** By building multiple Chronospheres, players can carry over essential late-game resources (like unobtanium, antimatter, and blueprints). This drastically speeds up subsequent runs, allowing players to immediately purchase most high-tier technologies and upgrades after a reset.
*   **The Chrono-Reset Loop:** The concept of the "quick" chrono-reset involves building Chronospheres out of the resource profit generated from the reset itself, leading to faster paragon farming.
*   **Void Acquisition:** The Void resource generated by Chronospheres is needed to unlock high-tier Metaphysics upgrades (like **Void Space** and **Paradox Theory**) and to purchase upgrades like **Cryochambers** and **Void Rifts**.
*   **Unobtainium Capacity Goal:** A late-game goal is to build enough Chronospheres to reach an extreme Unobtainium capacity (e.g., 8.14 billion UO capacity to build 100 Chronospheres).

### 4. Key Upgrades (Flux Condensator)

The utility of the Chronosphere is greatly enhanced by the **Flux Condensator** upgrade:

*   **Flux Condensator:** This upgrade costs 250 Alloy, 5,000 Unobtainium, and 5 Time Crystals.
    *   It causes Chronospheres to affect **craftable resources** (like Beam, Slab, Steel, Blueprint, and Megalith).
    *   The amount preserved is calculated with diminishing returns: **$1.5 \times (\text{# of Chronospheres}) \times \sqrt{\text{resource amount}}$** of each craftable resource is carried over on reset.

### 5. Challenge Interaction

*   **Challenges and Reserves:** When resetting with most challenges active, Chronospheres **will not** bring over any resources. Instead, resources are placed in reserves and can be reclaimed after the challenge is complete.
*   **Iron Will:** Iron Will mode is entered by resetting with **zero** Chronospheres.
