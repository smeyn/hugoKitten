The **Accelerator** is a specialized, late-game building in *Kittens Game*, unlocked through advanced technology. Its primary function is resource conversion, specifically processing Titanium into Uranium, and greatly increasing resource storage capacity through upgrades.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Accelerator:

### 1. Construction and Core Function

The Accelerator building is a vital component of the late-game resource chain, particularly in the run-up to unlocking **Metaphysics**.

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** The Accelerator is unlocked by researching **Particle Physics**. Particle Physics requires 185,000 Science and 135 Blueprints.
*   **Base Cost:** 7,500 Titanium, 125 Concrete, and 25 Uranium.
*   **Conversion Production:** The Accelerator is designed to convert Titanium into Uranium, consuming energy in the process.
    *   **Consumption:** -0.015 Titanium per Tick.
    *   **Production:** +0.0025 Uranium per Tick.
    *   **Energy:** It consumes **-2 Energy** per tick to operate.

The Accelerator is one of the buildings whose output is considered "Conversion production" and can be boosted by policies like **Autocracy**.

### 2. Strategic Role and Bottleneck Mitigation

Accelerators help address the significant bottleneck of obtaining Uranium, which is required for Reactors and later converted into Unobtainium by the Lunar Outpost.

*   **Uranium Source:** It is one of the ways Uranium can be produced, alongside trading with Dragons and production from Quarries after the Orbital Geodesy upgrade.
*   **Efficiency Concerns:** The initial conversion rate is slow; one Accelerator creates Uranium at a rate 140 times slower than a Lunar Outpost consumes it. This means if the Accelerator is the sole source of Uranium, the Lunar Outpost will run 140 times slower. Players are advised to create **multiple Accelerators** to speed things up, or rely on trading with Dragons for Uranium.
*   **Dark Future Mitigation:** Accelerators can be purchased to "ward off" the rising Time Crystal cost caused by the "dark future" mechanic, although players are advised not to worry about this too much as the effect is minimal.

### 3. Key Upgrades (Energy Rifts)

The most notable feature of the Accelerator is its ability to unlock substantial storage upgrades through the "Energy Rifts" technology, significantly boosting resource capacity.

| Upgrade Name | Technology Prerequisite | Effect (Storage Boost per Accelerator) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Energy Rifts** | Dimensional Physics | Unlocks substantial storage capacity for Catnip, Wood, Minerals, Iron, Coal, Gold, and Titanium. |
| **Stasis Chambers** | Chronophysics | Increases the storage gain from Energy Rifts by **+95%**. |
| **Void Energy** | Stasis Chambers | Increases the storage gain from Energy Rifts by **+75%**. |
| **Dark Energy** | Void Energy | Increases the storage gain from Energy Rifts by **+250%**. |
| **Tachyon Accelerators** | Tachyon Theory | Increases the storage gain from Energy Rifts by **+500%**. |

Furthermore, the **LHC** upgrade (unlocked by Dimensional Physics) provides a bonus of **+2500 Max Science per Accelerator**.

In the late game, using the **Energy Rift** upgrade is key to increasing storage capacity for unobtainium.

### 4. Challenge Context

*   **Energy Challenge:** The Accelerator is **not** listed among the necessary buildings required to complete the **Energy Challenge**, which focuses on energy *production* buildings (Steamworks, Magneto, Solar Farms, Hydro Plant, Reactor, Satellite, Sunlifter, Tectonic, HR Harvester).
*   **Paragon Grind:** In the Paragon grinding phase, after the 40K mark, the advice is to buy a few Time Impedances and Accelerators to slow down the rising Time Crystal cost due to "dark future".
