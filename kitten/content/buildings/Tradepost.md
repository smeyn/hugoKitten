The [Tradepost]( {{< relref "tradepost.md" >}}) is an early-game cultural building in *Kittens Game* that facilitates international commerce and manages the demand for luxury resources.

Here is a breakdown of the Tradepost's purpose, costs, and strategic value, drawing on the sources provided:

### 1. Construction and Unlocks

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** The Tradepost building is unlocked by researching the [Currency]( {{< relref "currency.md" >}}) technology. Currency costs 2,200 Science.
*   **Cost:** The base cost to construct a Tradepost is **500 Wood, 200 Minerals, and 10 Gold**.
*   **Price Ratio:** The Tradepost has a price ratio of 1.15.

### 2. Purpose and Effects

The Tradepost provides benefits related to trade and resource consumption:

*   **Trade Bonus:** It increases your effectiveness in trade by **+1.5%**.
*   **Luxury Demand Reduction:** It reduces the consumption rate of luxury resources (Furs, Ivory, Spice) by **-4%**.
*   **Gold Consumption:** The guide suggests building Tradeposts to **use up excess gold**.

### 3. Key Upgrades and Synergies

The Tradepost is essential for unlocking an important upgrade that manages race relations:

*   **Caravanserai Upgrade:** Researching [Navigation]( {{< relref "navigation.md" >}}) technology allows you to purchase the [Caravanserai]( {{< relref "caravanserai.md" >}}) upgrade.
    *   This upgrade costs **25,000 Science, 10,000 Ivory, and 250 Gold**.
    *   It gives Tradeposts a minor effect on race standing. Specifically, each Tradepost decreases the hostile event probability by **0.35%** and increases the friendly event probability by **0.175%**.
    *   For example, 85 Tradeposts can negate the chance that the hostile [Zebras]( {{< relref "trade/zebras.md" >}}) will give you nothing during a trade (or 58 if you have the Diplomacy Metaphysics upgrade).

### 4. Strategic Role and Context

Tradeposts are important during the mid-game transition, particularly when dealing with hostile races and managing luxury resources:

*   **Trade Ratio Boost:** The **Pacifism Challenge** reward involves the trade ratio, where the reward either gives a ratio boost times the number of Tradeposts you have, or a flat boost to the number of Tradeposts, whichever is smaller. The ratio boost begins at 10.65% of your Tradeposts and increases linearly per completion.
*   **Trading with Leviathans:** The amount of Time Crystals received per trade with the Leviathans is affected by the number of Tradeposts built.
*   **Luxury Management:** Experts generally favor the **Epicureanism** philosophy policy over [Stoicism]( {{< relref "stoicism.md" >}}), noting that by the time Epicureanism is available, players should have plenty of **Tradeposts to slow down luxury consumption**.

### 5. Trade Unlocking Context

The ability to trade with other races, which Tradeposts enhance, is unlocked when a member of the Lizards arrives at your Village, usually after 20 years of game play. You must first research the [Gold Ore]( {{< relref "gold_ore.md" >}}) upgrade (unlocked by [Currency]( {{< relref "currency.md" >}})) to produce Gold in your Smelters before you can trade with anyone.
