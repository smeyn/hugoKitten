The Amphitheatre is a vital early-game building designed to manage population morale and introduce the critical resource, [Culture]( {{< relref "culture.md" >}}).

Here is a detailed explanation of the Amphitheatre:

### Purpose and Effects

The primary function of the Amphitheatre is to combat the negative effects of population growth on your civilization's efficiency.

*   **Unhappiness Reduction:** As your kitten population rises, they become unhappy, which acts as a "production killer" that reduces overall efficiency. The Amphitheatre directly addresses this by reducing **Unhappiness by -4.8%**.
*   **Culture Generation:** Amphitheatres are the earliest buildings available for generating the resource [Culture]( {{< relref "culture.md" >}}). They provide **+0.005 Culture per Tick** and increase the **Max Culture limit by +50**. Culture is necessary for crafting Manuscripts, which are required for subsequent advanced technologies like Theology.

### Acquisition and Cost

The Amphitheatre building is unlocked once you research the [Writing]( {{< relref "writing.md" >}}) technology.

To construct a single Amphitheatre, the costs are:

*   200 Wood
*   1,200 Minerals
*   3 Parchment
*   The price ratio for successive purchases increases by 1.15.

### Strategic Importance

Amphitheatres are considered **extremely important in the early game**.

*   Players are advised to build Amphitheatres until they stop noticeably improving Happiness, a metric monitored by the ‘population penalty’ percentage shown on the top bar of the game.
*   Accumulating Amphitheatres helps facilitate the path to Temples, as they are essential for generating the Culture needed for Manuscripts. Furthermore, maximizing Amphitheatres and Temples is recommended when preparing to grind out manuscripts for advanced sciences.
*   Karma, gained upon resetting the game, increases overall happiness, which in turn helps offset the need for Amphitheatres as much as they are needed in earlier runs.

### Upgrade Path

The Amphitheatre is a building that can be later upgraded to a [Broadcast Tower]( {{< relref "broadcast_tower.md" >}}). This upgrade is highly beneficial:

*   For **Happiness purposes**, a single Broadcast Tower is potent enough to replace your entire stock of Amphitheatres.
*   For **Culture purposes**, a single tower can increase the maximum culture capacity as much as six Amphitheatres and increase production as much as *two hundred* Amphitheatres. Consequently, there is little reason to delay this upgrade once the metal resources are available.
