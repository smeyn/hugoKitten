The **Academy** is a significant early-to-mid-game science building in *Kittens Game*, unlocked through the core Science technology path.

### Unlocks and Cost

The Academy building is unlocked once you research the **Mathematics** technology.

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** **Mathematics**, which costs 1,000 Science.
*   **Base Cost:** The construction requires **50 Wood, 70 Minerals, and 100 Science**.
*   **Price Ratio:** The Academy has a price ratio of 1.15.

### Primary Effects

The Academy provides multiple benefits, focusing on science, culture capacity, and kitten efficiency:

*   **Science Production:** It increases Science production by **+20%**. The sources note that Academies grant a **decent bonus** to the accumulation of Science.
*   **Science Capacity:** It increases your maximum Science capacity by **+500**.
*   **Culture Capacity:** It increases your maximum Culture capacity by **+25**.
*   **Kitten Experience:** It provides a **+5% bonus to Kitten Experience (Exp)**.

### Strategic Role

Academies play an important role in the game progression, particularly in scaling up science and culture caps:

*   **Science Growth:** Researching Mathematics to unlock Academies is described as "especially useful" for improving the accumulation of Science.
*   **Culture Cap:** Academies are listed as buildings that increase culture cap, along with Libraries. They contribute to the total culture cap needed to unlock trade with the Nagas (1,500 culture cap).
*   **Science Limit:** Academies are listed as structures that contribute to increasing maximum storage for Science, which is the third most important thing in the game, behind production and resource caps.

### Upgrades

The Academy has a dedicated upgrade that enhances its functionality:

*   **Minerology Department:** This upgrade provides a **+1% bonus to production from meteors**.

Academies are one of the core buildings (along with Libraries, Observatories, and Bio Labs) whose effectiveness can be boosted by the **CAD System** workshop upgrade, which improves blueprint crafting ratio.
