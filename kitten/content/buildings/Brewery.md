The [Brewery]( {{< relref "brewery.md" >}}) is an industrial building in *Kittens Game* that specializes in boosting the effects of festivals, often considered a non-essential but beneficial structure for players advancing into the mid-game and later religious/cultural phases.

### Unlocking and Construction

The Brewery is part of a non-mandatory branch of the Technology tree.

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** The Brewery is unlocked by researching [Drama and Poetry]( {{< relref "drama_and_poetry.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:** Building a Brewery requires a combination of common and luxury resources: **1000 Wood, 750 Culture, 5 Spice, and 375 Parchment**.
*   **Initial Advice:** The technology that unlocks the Brewery, Drama and Poetry, is noted to be "waaaay too expensive to be useful" on a player's first couple of runs, and players are advised to **feel free to skip it** initially.

### Function and Consumption

The Brewery provides passive benefits related to festivals, and consumes two resources:

| Resource | Effect/Consumption | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Festival Happiness** | +1% | |
| **Festival Cycle Bonus** | +1% | |
| **Festival Kitten Speed** | +0.1% | |
| **Catnip Consumption** | -1 per Tick | |
| **Spice Consumption** | -0.1 per Tick | |

### Strategic Context and Synergies

1.  **Festival Enhancement:** The Brewery's effect on the "Festival Cycle Bonus" is important in the late game. If the **Numeromancy** Metaphysics upgrade is researched, the cycle-based bonuses granted by holding a festival are boosted, and Breweries further enhance these effects.
2.  **Policy Interaction:**
    *   The [Stoicism]( {{< relref "stoicism.md" >}}) philosophy policy, which aims to reduce the consumption of luxury resources, provides a reduction of **-25% to brewery consumption**.
    *   The foreign policy **Shark Relations: Botanists** grants a **1% Brewery catpower bonus**.
3.  **Resource Management:** Breweries consume [Spice]( {{< relref "spice.md" >}}), a luxury resource that gradually degrades over time and is sometimes received when trading with other races.
