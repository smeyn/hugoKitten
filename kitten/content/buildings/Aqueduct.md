The [Aqueduct]( {{< relref "aqueduct.md" >}}) is an early-to-mid-game food production building in *Kittens Game*, unlocked through the technological progression.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Aqueduct based on the provided sources:

### 1. Construction and Unlocks

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** The Aqueduct is unlocked by researching [Engineering]( {{< relref "engineering.md" >}}). Engineering itself is unlocked by [Construction]( {{< relref "construction.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:** The base cost to construct an Aqueduct is **75 Minerals**, and it has a price ratio of 1.12.
*   **Visibility:** Like most buildings, the Aqueduct will stay hidden in the Bonfire tab until you have at least 30% of the necessary resources to build the first one.

### 2. Purpose and Effects

The Aqueduct's primary function is to boost Catnip production by applying a percentile bonus:

*   **Catnip Production:** It provides a **+3% bonus to Catnip production**.
*   **Strategy Recommendation:** Players are advised to research [Engineering]( {{< relref "engineering.md" >}}) and **build lots of Aqueducts**, as they increase Catnip production by a percentile and should be "far cheaper for a while" compared to constantly buying more Catnip Fields.

### 3. Upgrades and Progression

The Aqueduct is categorized as an **Upgraded Building**, meaning it can be converted into a more advanced structure:

*   **Upgrade Path:** The Aqueduct can be upgraded to a [Hydro Plant]( {{< relref "hydro_plant.md" >}}).
*   **Strategic Conversion Advice:** The decision to upgrade is based on resource needs: "When you need **Energy more than you need catnip**".
    *   Demolishing Aqueducts carelessly by upgrading them can quickly lead to a **starvation situation**.
    *   The guide notes that upgrading Aqueducts to Hydro Plants is a riskier conversion than upgrading Pastures to Solar Farms.
    *   Hydro Plants also cost a fair amount of [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}), so players should wait until they have good Titanium production before switching.

### 4. General Economic Context

The Aqueduct is part of the early game routine focused on establishing a strong economic foundation, known as the **Basic Resource Rotation (BRR)**. After capping catnip fields and focusing on wood, the routine advises focusing on minerals and then mineral-only buildings, which includes Aqueducts.
