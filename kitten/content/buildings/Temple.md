The **Temple** is a critical mid-game building in *Kittens Game*, serving as a foundational structure for both your society's culture and its religious system.

It is unlocked after researching the **Philosophy** technology.

### Construction and Base Effects

The Temple is a key building in the Culture category.

| Detail | Requirement/Value | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Technology Prerequisite** | **Philosophy** | |
| **Base Cost** | 25 Slab, 15 Plate, 50 Gold, 10 Manuscript | |
| **Primary Outputs** | +0.1 Culture per Tick; Unlocks the **Order of the Sun** religion tab | |
| **Storage Increase** | +100 Max Faith | |

### Strategic Purpose and Progression

The Temple is highly significant because it helps overcome a major early bottleneck and initiates the Faith system:

1.  **Culture Generation:** Temples are a source of **Culture**, alongside Amphitheatres and Chapels. Culture is required to craft **Manuscripts**, which are necessary for researching advanced technologies like **Theology** and **Astronomy**. Amphitheatres are the earliest buildings to generate culture, which helps make "getting temples easier".
2.  **Faith Production:** Temples are essential for generating **Faith**. Once the subsequent technology, **Theology**, is researched, Temples each begin generating **0.0015 Faith per tick**. Faith is an expendable resource used exclusively via the Religion tab to purchase upgrades.
3.  **Gold Sink and Priority:** After learning Philosophy and once happiness is stable, players are strongly advised to focus on Temples and to "spend all your gold on temples". As a general rule, if a Temple can be built soon, it "should be built before anything else".

### Upgrades and Synergies

Temples benefit directly from several upgrades, primarily found within the **Order of the Sun** religion tab, which is unlocked by the Temple itself. These religious upgrades use Faith to enhance the Temple's non-religious utility, often contributing to Science, Culture, and Happiness:

*   **Faith and Worship:** Upgrades like **Golden Spire** (+50% max faith) and **Sun Altar** (+50 max faith) increase the capacity for faith storage within Temples.
*   **Science and Culture:**
    *   **Scholasticism** grants Temples a bonus of **+500 Max Science**.
    *   **Stained Glass** provides an additional **+0.1 Culture per tick**.
    *   **Basilica** provides **+0.2 Culture per tick** and **+125 Max Culture** from Temples.
*   **Happiness:** **Sun Altar** increases the overall Happiness bonus by **+0.5%**.
*   **Catpower:** **Templars** increases the maximum catpower by **+75** per Temple.

The total accumulation of Culture from Temples and Amphitheatres is necessary to eventually unlock the **Trade with Nagas**, which requires 1500 Culture Cap. Furthermore, the eventual goal for many players is the **Solar Revolution** upgrade, which relies on generating high amounts of Worship (converted from Faith via Temples and Chapels).
