The [Temple]( {{< relref "temple.md" >}}) is a critical mid-game building in *Kittens Game*, serving as a foundational structure for both your society's culture and its religious system.

It is unlocked after researching the [Philosophy]( {{< relref "techs/Philosophy.md" >}}) technology.

### Construction and Base Effects

The Temple is a key building in the Culture category.

| Detail | Requirement/Value | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Technology Prerequisite** | [Philosophy]( {{< relref "techs/Philosophy.md" >}}) | |
| **Base Cost** | 25 Slab, 15 Plate, 50 Gold, 10 Manuscript | |
| **Primary Outputs** | +0.1 Culture per Tick; Unlocks the **Order of the Sun** religion tab | |
| **Storage Increase** | +100 Max Faith | |

### Strategic Purpose and Progression

The Temple is highly significant because it helps overcome a major early bottleneck and initiates the Faith system:

1.  **Culture Generation:** Temples are a source of [Culture]( {{< relref "culture.md" >}}), alongside Amphitheatres and Chapels. Culture is required to craft [Manuscripts]( {{< relref "craft/Manuscript.md" >}}), which are necessary for researching advanced technologies like [Theology]( {{< relref "techs/Theology.md" >}}) and [Astronomy]( {{< relref "astronomy.md" >}}). Amphitheatres are the earliest buildings to generate culture, which helps make "getting temples easier".
2.  **Faith Production:** Temples are essential for generating [Faith]( {{< relref "faith.md" >}}). Once the subsequent technology, [Theology]( {{< relref "techs/Theology.md" >}}), is researched, Temples each begin generating **0.0015 Faith per tick**. Faith is an expendable resource used exclusively via the Religion tab to purchase upgrades.
3.  **Gold Sink and Priority:** After learning Philosophy and once happiness is stable, players are strongly advised to focus on Temples and to "spend all your gold on temples". As a general rule, if a Temple can be built soon, it "should be built before anything else".

### Upgrades and Synergies

Temples benefit directly from several upgrades, primarily found within the **Order of the Sun** religion tab, which is unlocked by the Temple itself. These religious upgrades use Faith to enhance the Temple's non-religious utility, often contributing to Science, Culture, and Happiness:

*   **Faith and Worship:** Upgrades like [Golden Spire]( {{< relref "golden_spire.md" >}}) (+50% max faith) and [Sun Altar]( {{< relref "sun_altar.md" >}}) (+50 max faith) increase the capacity for faith storage within Temples.
*   **Science and Culture:**
    *   [Scholasticism]( {{< relref "scholasticism.md" >}}) grants Temples a bonus of **+500 Max Science**.
    *   [Stained Glass]( {{< relref "stained_glass.md" >}}) provides an additional **+0.1 Culture per tick**.
    *   [Basilica]( {{< relref "basilica.md" >}}) provides **+0.2 Culture per tick** and **+125 Max Culture** from Temples.
*   [Happiness:]( {{< relref "happiness.md" >}}) [Sun Altar]( {{< relref "sun_altar.md" >}}) increases the overall Happiness bonus by **+0.5%**.
*   **Catpower:** [Templars]( {{< relref "templars.md" >}}) increases the maximum catpower by **+75** per Temple.

The total accumulation of Culture from Temples and Amphitheatres is necessary to eventually unlock the **Trade with Nagas**, which requires 1500 Culture Cap. Furthermore, the eventual goal for many players is the [Solar Revolution]( {{< relref "solar_revolution.md" >}}) upgrade, which relies on generating high amounts of Worship (converted from Faith via Temples and Chapels).
