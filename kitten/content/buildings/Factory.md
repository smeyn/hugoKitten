The [Factory]( {{< relref "buildings/Factory.md" >}}) is a mid-to-late-game industrial building in *Kittens Game*, primarily focused on boosting **crafting efficiency** and playing a role in advanced resource production, pollution management, and policy prerequisites.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the Factory:

### 1. Unlocking and Cost

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** The Factory is unlocked by researching [Mechanization]( {{< relref "techs/Mechanization.md" >}}), which costs 115K Science and 45 Blueprints, and follows the Industrialization branch.
*   **Resource Cost:** Factories are expensive, requiring three processed, mid-game resources:
    *   [Titanium:]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) 2000 units
    *   [Plate:]( {{< relref "resource/plate.md" >}}) 2500 units
    *   [Concrete:]( {{< relref "craft/Concrete.md" >}}) 15 units
*   **Price Ratio:** The Factory has a price ratio of 1.15.
*   **Policy Reduction:** The [Communism]( {{< relref "policies/Communism.md" >}}) policy makes factories **30% cheaper**.

### 2. Effects and Function

The Factory's primary effect is boosting crafting efficiency and consuming energy:

*   **Crafting Bonus:** Each Factory provides a **+5% Crafting** bonus. This bonus is equivalent to the effect provided by a kitten with the Artisan trait when they are selected as the leader.
*   **Energy Consumption:** Each Factory consumes **-2 Energy**.
*   **Pollution:** Factories are listed among the structures that produce **pollution**. However, pollution produced by factories can be reduced to zero by the [Carbon Sequestration]( {{< relref "upgrade/Carbon_Sequestration.md" >}}) upgrade.

### 3. Upgrades and Policy Interactions

Factories are central to several mid-to-late-game scaling mechanics:

*   **Policy Prerequisite:** Factories are required to unlock high-tier Government policies such as [Liberalism]( {{< relref "policies/Liberalism.md" >}}), [Communism]( {{< relref "policies/Communism.md" >}}), and [Fascism]( {{< relref "policies/Fascism.md" >}}).
    *   If you choose the [Full Industrialization]( {{< relref "policies/Full_Industrialization.md" >}}) policy (which follows Strip Mining or Clear Cutting), the crafting bonus from Factories is further improved by **5%** (e.g., from +5% to +5.25%, or from +6% to +6.3% depending on upgrades). This policy is recommended from the second run onward, as players will be building many Factories.
*   **Crafting Boost Upgrades:**
    *   The [Factory Logistics]( {{< relref "upgrade/Factory_Logistics.md" >}}) Workshop upgrade increases the craft bonus of Factories by an additional **+1%**.
*   [Space Manufacturing:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Space_Manufacturing.md" >}}) The [Space Manufacturing]( {{< relref "upgrade/Space_Manufacturing.md" >}}) upgrade enables Factories to improve **Space Elevators** and **Orbital Arrays** by **3.75% per factory** (4.5% with Factory Logistics). This bonus is crucial because most production bonuses (like Paragon and Magnetos) do not apply to space structures, making Factories one of the few ways to increase space building production efficiency.
*   **Oil and Refinement:** The [Factory Processing]( {{< relref "upgrade/Factory_Processing.md" >}}) upgrade, unlocked by Oil Processing Science, causes every Factory to increase oil refinement effectiveness by **5%**. Factories also help oil production once the **Hydraulic Fracturers** are employed (unlocked by the Dune Mission).
*   **Pollution Mitigation:** The [Carbon Sequestration]( {{< relref "upgrade/Carbon_Sequestration.md" >}}) upgrade allows Factories to capture pollution from the atmosphere instead of creating it by consuming 4Wt of energy per Factory, reducing pollution by 2 points per tick.

### 4. Strategic Role

Factories are built to enhance the creation of complex resources needed for endgame technologies, especially in subsequent runs.

*   **Endgame Crafting:** Factories are maximized (along with Workshops) to increase the crafting ratio, which helps reduce the number of crafts needed to produce high-tier materials like [Eludium]( {{< relref "resource/eludium.md" >}}).
*   **Unobtainium Production:** Factories are instrumental in maximizing Unobtainium production in the late game through the Space Manufacturing upgrade. They contribute to the space production bonus via the number of Factories and the Factory Logistics upgrade.
*   **Blueprint Generation:** Factories contribute indirectly to the essential task of generating [Blueprints]( {{< relref "resource/Blueprint.md" >}}) by boosting the crafting process (Furs $\to$ Parchment $\to$ Manuscript $\to$ Compendium $\to$ Blueprint).
*   **Building Priority:** Factories are one of the key production-boosting structures that "should be built provided you have the resources to use on them" in the mid-to-late game.
