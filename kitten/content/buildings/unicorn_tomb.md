The [Unicorn Tomb]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Unicorn_Tomb.md" >}}) is an early building within the Unicorn religious progression chain, serving as a direct upgrade to the **Unicorn Pasture** [1].

This structure is vital for establishing the infrastructure necessary to scale luxury and temporal resources like Tears and Time Crystals in the mid-to-late game.

### Details and Effects

| Category | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prerequisite** | The Unicorn Tomb is an upgrade available after successfully building a **Unicorn Pasture** [1, 2]. |
| **Cost** | Building a Unicorn Tomb requires **5 Tears** and **500 Ivory** [1, 3]. |
| **Effect** | It provides a 5% improvement to **unicorn generation** (Unicorns per Tick +5%) [1, 3]. |
| **Progression** | Completing at least one Unicorn Tomb is the direct prerequisite for unlocking the [Ivory Tower]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Ivory_Tower.md" >}}) [4]. |

### Context in Religious Progression

The Unicorn Tomb is placed early in the sequence of unicorn buildings that scale unicorn production and eventually lead to the coveted Time Crystal economy:

$$
\text{Unicorn Pasture} \to \textbf{Unicorn Tomb} \to \text{Ivory Tower} \to \text{Ivory Citadel} \to \text{Sky Palace} \to \text{Unicorn Utopia} \to \text{Sunspire}
$$

The entire chain is essential because the Unicorns generated are later **sacrificed in Ziggurats to produce Tears** [5], which are required to build the Unicorn Tomb itself and subsequent structures [1, 3, 4].

### Challenge Reward

The Unicorn Tomb gains a special utility if you complete the **Unicorn Tears** challenge. As the base reward for completing this challenge, Unicorn Tombs receive the additional benefit of **increasing maximum faith based on Transcendence Tier** [6].
