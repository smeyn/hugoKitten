The [Sky Palace]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Sky_Palace.md" >}}) is an advanced religious building that plays a crucial role in the late Phase 2 (the Unicorn/Time Crystal Era) progression by generating the unique resource, [Alicorns]( {{< relref "resource/alicorn.md" >}}).

### Functionality and Effects

*   **Prerequisite:** The Sky Palace is unlocked after building at least one [Ivory Citadel]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Ivory_Citadel.md" >}}) (a preceding unicorn religious upgrade) [1].
*   **Cost:** It requires a substantial investment of **500 Tears**, **125,000 Ivory**, and **5 Megalith** [1].
*   **Unicorn Production:** It provides a significant boost to **unicorn generation** by **+50%** [1].
*   **Alicorn Generation:** The Sky Palace enables a random event that grants one [alicorn]( {{< relref "resource/alicorn.md" >}}) [1]. The frequency of this event increases by **0.01% per game-day** for each Sky Palace, meaning it takes 100 Palaces to increase the chance by 1% per day [1]. Additionally, each Sky Palace produces a very slow passive rate of **0.00002 alicorns per tick** (or 0.08 per year) [1].
*   **Other Bonuses:** It also improves **gold storage by +1%** and increases **ivory gained from Ivory Meteors by 5%** [1].

### Strategic Context

The Sky Palace is strategically important because it is a prerequisite for subsequent powerful religious upgrades and resources:

*   **Progression Path:** Building a Sky Palace is necessary to unlock the [Unicorn Utopia]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Unicorn_Utopia.md" >}}) upgrade [2].
*   **Time Crystal Economy:** The alicorns generated by the Sky Palace are essential because **sacrificing 25 alicorns yields one Time Crystal** [3, 4]. Alicorns are therefore a key input for the temporal economy [5].
*   **Ivory Acquisition:** The Sky Palace is part of a series of unicorn buildings (including Ivory Tower and Ivory Citadel) [1, 6] that are targeted early in the Unicorn Era to provide a passive, AFK source of [ivory]( {{< relref "resource/ivory.md" >}}) (via Ivory Meteors) [1, 5, 7], which is needed to trade for minerals with the Nagas [8].

In general late-game strategy, obtaining the Sky Palace and continuing the unicorn pathway (Unicorn Utopia, Sunspire) is advised to maximize the **alicorn summon chance** and conversion efficiency for generating Time Crystals [2, 9].
