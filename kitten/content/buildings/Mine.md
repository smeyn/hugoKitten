The [Mine]( {{< relref "buildings/Mine.md" >}}) is a foundational resource-gathering building in *Kittens Game*, crucial for establishing mineral production and unlocking the Miner profession.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Mine:

### 1. Unlocking and Cost

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** The Mine is unlocked after researching [Mining]( {{< relref "techs/Mining.md" >}}). Mining costs **500 Science** and is unlocked after [Agriculture]( {{< relref "techs/Agriculture.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:** The Mine building requires **100 Wood** to construct, and it has a price ratio of 1.15.

### 2. Primary Effects and Function

The Mine is the key structure for accessing and increasing your Minerals supply:

*   **Mineral Production Bonus:** Each Mine built provides a **+20% Minerals** bonus.
*   **Unlocks Job:** Building a Mine unlocks the [Miner]( {{< relref "job/Miner.md" >}}) job, allowing you to employ Kittens to accumulate resources. Kittens assigned as Miners produce **0.05 Minerals per Tick**.
*   **Meteors:** Researching Mining also enables **Meteors**, which automatically grant a small boost to Minerals when they fall near your village. In the challenging **Iron Will** mode (playing without kittens/housing), Meteors are the **only initial source of Minerals**, and building more Mines increases the amount of minerals gained from these events.
*   **Pollution:** Mines are listed among the structures that produce pollution, which negatively impacts catnip production, happiness, and kitten arrival speed.

### 3. Upgrades and Strategic Role

While essential in the early game, the effectiveness of Mines is often compared to superior global multipliers later on.

*   **Coal Production Upgrade:** The Mine building can be upgraded through the [Deep Mining]( {{< relref "upgrade/Deep_Mining.md" >}}) Workshop upgrade, which is unlocked by researching [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}). Deep Mining allows Mines to produce [Coal]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}) at a rate of **0.003 coal per Tick** (or 0.015 per second).
*   **Strategic Priority:** Minerals quickly become increasingly important for advanced buildings. Building Mines is a component of the Basic Resource Rotation (BRR) recommended in the early game to ensure a strong economic foundation by focusing on basic resource buildings.
*   **Scaling:** Although necessary for initial progression, experts suggest that structures like Mines are generally considered "pretty lame" and inefficient beyond the early game when compared to global production boosts like happiness or Magnetos.
