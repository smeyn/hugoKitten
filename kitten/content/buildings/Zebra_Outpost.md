The [Zebra Outpost]( {{< relref "zebra_outpost.md" >}}) is the foundational building associated with the Zebra civilization in *Kittens Game*. It is one of three specialized Zebra buildings, all unlocked early in the game's technological progression.

Here are the details regarding the Zebra Outpost:

### 1. Construction and Unlocks

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** The Zebra Outpost is unlocked by researching the [Archery]( {{< relref "archery.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Cost:** It requires **1 Bloodstone** to construct.
*   **Price Ratio:** The building has a price ratio of 1.35.

### 2. Effects and Purpose

The Zebra Outpost provides two main benefits:

*   **Hunting Bonus:** It grants a **+5% bonus to Hunting**.
*   **Catpower Capacity:** It increases your maximum Catpower by **+5**.

The hunting bonus is significant, as the ability to hunt is unlocked by the same technology (Archery), allowing you to accumulate rare resources like Furs and Ivory, which are used for happiness and crafting.

### 3. Strategic Context (Iron Will Mode)

The Zebra Outpost is particularly relevant in the **Iron Will** challenge:

*   **Zebra Limit:** In the Iron Will challenge, where players cannot build housing and thus cannot assign kitten jobs, Zebras act as hunters to replace the missing kitten population.
*   **Acquisition:** If a player, while in Iron Will mode, researches Archery and their Zebra limit is less than 10, their Zebra limit increases by 1. The maximum number of Zebras obtained this way is 10 (or possibly 11, depending on other limits).
*   **Production Cap:** The [Dark Revolution]( {{< relref "dark_revolution.md" >}}) policy increases the Zebra base catpower production cap by +1 (or +0.1 in non-Iron Will mode).
*   **Resetting for Zebras:** The **Iron Will** procedure involves resetting the game after achieving Archery multiple times to accumulate a higher Zebra limit before embarking on a longer run. This is done to gain sufficient Catpower generation for hunting, which is essential for acquiring early resources.

### Progression of Zebra Buildings

The Zebra Outpost is the first of three Zebra buildings, followed by the Zebra Workshop and the Zebra Forge, all unlocked by Archery:

*   [Zebra Outpost:]( {{< relref "zebra_outpost.md" >}}) 1 Bloodstone.
*   [Zebra Workshop:]( {{< relref "zebra_workshop.md" >}}) 5 Bloodstone; this unlocks additional Zebra Upgrades.
*   [Zebra Forge:]( {{< relref "zebra_forge.md" >}}) 50 Bloodstone; this unlocks the crafting of Bloodstone and T-Mythril.
