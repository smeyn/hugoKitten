Build a house (each has a space for 1 kitten)

The [Log House]( {{< relref "buildings/Log_House.md" >}}) is an important early-to-mid-game population building in *Kittens Game*, serving as an upgrade to the basic [Hut]( {{< relref "buildings/Hut.md" >}}) and contributing to population growth and resource capacity.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Log House:

### Unlocking and Cost

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** Log Houses are unlocked after researching [Construction]( {{< relref "techs/Construction.md" >}}). Construction costs 1300 Science and is unlocked after [Animal Husbandry]( {{< relref "techs/Animal_Husbandry.md" >}}).
*   **Resource Cost:** Constructing a Log House requires both Wood and Minerals:
    *   **Wood:** 200 units
    *   **Minerals:** 250 units
    *   **Price Ratio:** Log Houses have a price ratio of 1.15.
*   **Acquisition Timing:** Players can start building Log Houses once they have Minerals.

### Effects

Log Houses primarily increase the maximum number of kittens your village can support and boost your Catpower limit.

*   **Maximum Kittens:** Each Log House increases the maximum number of kittens by **+1**.
*   **Maximum Catpower:** Each Log House increases the maximum Catpower storage by **+50**.
*   **Strategic Role:** Log Houses are key to increasing your kitten population. Since kittens are the primary unit of production, experts recommend keeping Huts and **Log Houses maxed out whenever possible** in the early game to maximize population.

### Comparison and Progression

Log Houses are the second tier of housing, following Huts, and preceding Mansions:

*   [Huts]( {{< relref "buildings/Hut.md" >}}) increase maximum kittens by +2 and maximum Catpower by +75. Log Houses are often built alongside Pastures to manage the increased kitten burden on Catnip supplies.
*   [Log Houses]( {{< relref "buildings/Log_House.md" >}}) can be seen as an intermediate population step before unlocking [Mansions]( {{< relref "buildings/Mansion.md" >}}) (requiring Slab, Steel, and Titanium, and unlocked by Architecture).
*   **Population Strategy:** Log Houses, along with Huts, are a focus point in the early game for maximizing global production since population acts as "THE global modifier" in early phases.

### Policy Influence

The [Fascism]( {{< relref "policies/Fascism.md" >}}) policy, unlocked later in the game (Phase 3), specifically benefits Log Houses:

*   **Fascism Policy Effect:** If you select Fascism (which requires building a Factory and having chosen Autocracy or Monarchy), **Log Houses cost half as much** (50% cheaper). Fascism also eliminates population penalties to happiness. This policy might be chosen on a first run to help reach 130+ kittens before the first reset, aided by the reduced Log House cost.

### Endgame Context (Paragon Grinding)

In later cycles, particularly when prioritizing maximum paragon gain in short runs, Log Houses are still essential housing components alongside Huts, Mansions, and Space Stations. Guidance for late-game paragon grinding often advises building the first few [Log Houses]( {{< relref "buildings/Log_House.md" >}}) quickly to allow kittens to trickle in during the first couple of minutes, before transitioning to more advanced housing options.
