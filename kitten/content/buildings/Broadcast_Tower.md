The Broadcast Tower is a powerful upgraded structure derived from the Amphitheatre, serving primarily to drastically improve your civilization's [Happiness]( {{< relref "happiness.md" >}}) and [Culture]( {{< relref "culture.md" >}}) mechanics.

### Acquisition and Cost

The Broadcast Tower is an upgrade path (indicated by ∨) from the Amphitheatre.

*   **Prerequisite:** The building upgrade is enabled once the [Electronics]( {{< relref "electronics.md" >}}) technology is researched.
*   **Cost:** Constructing a Broadcast Tower requires **1,250 Iron** and **75 Titanium**.
*   **Upgrade Advice:** There is very little reason to delay this upgrade once the necessary metal is acquired.

### Primary Effects

The Broadcast Tower's effects far surpass those of its prerequisite, the Amphitheatre:

1.  **Happiness Management:** The Broadcast Tower substantially reduces Unhappiness by **-75%**. Crucially, for managing population morale, **a single broadcast tower can replace your entire stock of amphitheaters**.
2.  **Culture Generation and Cap:** The tower provides massive bonuses to culture output and storage, with both effects tied to your Energy Surplus Ratio.
    *   It grants Culture per Tick equal to 1 times the Energy Surplus Ratio.
    *   It increases the Max Culture limit by 300 times the Energy Surplus Ratio.
    *   For comparison to the Amphitheatre, a single Broadcast Tower increases the culture cap by as much as **six amphitheaters**, and increases production by as much as ***two hundred*** [amphitheaters]( {{< relref "buildings/Amphitheater.md" >}}).

### Upgrades

Broadcast Towers can be further improved with the [Satellite Radio]( {{< relref "satellite_radio.md" >}}) upgrade. This upgrade increases the tower's Culture per Tick and Max Culture by **0.5% per active Satellite**.
