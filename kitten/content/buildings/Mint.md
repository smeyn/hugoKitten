The [Mint]( {{< relref "buildings/Mint.md" >}}) is a crucial mid-to-late-game building in *Kittens Game*, primarily focused on increasing gold storage and generating rare resources, specifically **Furs** and **Ivory**.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the Mint, including its prerequisites, costs, effects, and strategic usage:

### Unlocking and Cost

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** The Mint is unlocked after researching [Architecture]( {{< relref "techs/Architecture.md" >}}). Architecture costs 42,000 Science and 10 Compendiums, and is unlocked after Navigation.
*   **Resource Cost:** Building a Mint is expensive, requiring significant amounts of processed materials:
    *   **Minerals:** 5000 units
    *   [Plate:]( {{< relref "resource/plate.md" >}}) 200 units
    *   [Gold:]( {{< relref "resource/Gold.md" >}}) 500 units
*   **Price Ratio:** The Mint has a price ratio of 1.15.

### Effects and Function

The Mint has several specialized effects, making it a critical structure for resource stability and progression:

1.  **Rare Resource Generation:** The Mint generates valuable rare resources, consuming Catpower and Gold:
    *   **Furs per Tick:** +0.00875% of Max Catpower
    *   **Ivory per Tick:** +0.0021% of Max Catpower
    *   Furs and Ivory are rare resources that provide **+10% happiness** each but are gradually consumed over time.

2.  **Resource Consumption:** The Mint operates by consuming resources:
    *   **Catpower per Tick:** -0.75
    *   **Gold per Tick:** -0.005

3.  **Gold Storage:** Each Mint increases your maximum storage capacity for [Gold]( {{< relref "resource/Gold.md" >}}) by **+100**.
    *   This storage limit is essential because Gold is needed for trading, building Temples, and acquiring Tradeposts. Max Gold storage can be further increased by Workshop upgrades such as Reinforced Warehouses, Titanium Warehouses, Alloy Warehouses, Concrete Pillars, Concrete Warehouses, and Storage Bunkers.

### Strategic Role

Mints play a key role in the mid-to-late game, especially for automation and prestige farming:

*   **Ivory and Fur Stockpiling:** Mints allow you to generate Furs and Ivory *passively* based on your maximum Catpower, reducing the reliance on manually clicking "Send Hunters". This is especially useful for maintaining high happiness and is very useful to run when you are idling to stockpile Furs.
*   **Catpower Scaling:** Since Mint production scales with **maximum Catpower capacity**, continued investment in structures that boost Catpower (like [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}) and [Templars]( {{< relref "religion/Templars.md" >}})) and cheap housing is mandated to maintain maximum output.
*   **Blueprint Generation:** In the hyper-speed "quick chrono-reset" endgame phase, the focus shifts to **Mints for blueprint generation**. Mints generate Furs, which can be crafted into Parchment, and subsequently into Manuscripts, Compendiums, and finally Blueprints. This method is preferred over hunting/crafting because Mints do not spend catpower, allowing it to grow for later use.
*   **Gold Acquisition:** Mints are production-boosting buildings that increase gold storage capacity. Gold is a necessary input for building [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}) (for Faith/Culture) and [Tradeposts]( {{< relref "buildings/Tradepost.md" >}}) (for trade effectiveness).
*   **Policy Interaction:** The [Frugality]( {{< relref "policies/Frugality.md" >}}) policy (part of the Stoicism philosophy tree) directly impacts Mints by making them **10% more effective at producing resources**.
*   **Usage Advice:** Experts advise running Mints when you are idling to stockpile Furs, but to **turn them off when you are active** to manage resource consumption. Furthermore, Mints, like Steamworks, are generally structures you should only use when away from your computer in the mid-game, as they can limit coal production.
