The [Harbour]( {{< relref "buildings/Harbour.md" >}}) is a crucial mid-game storage building in *Kittens Game*, essential for expanding resource limits, especially as your civilization begins advanced production and trading operations.

Here is a detailed overview of the Harbour:

### Unlocking and Cost

The Harbour is unlocked after reaching the Navigation stage of your technology tree, and it requires crafted materials to build:

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** [Navigation]( {{< relref "techs/Navigation.md" >}}).
*   **Resource Cost:** Building a Harbour costs a combination of processed materials:
    *   [Scaffold:]( {{< relref "craft/Scaffold.md" >}}) 5 units
    *   **Slab:** 50 units
    *   [Plate:]( {{< relref "resource/plate.md" >}}) 75 units. Plate is listed as a craftable resource required for early and mid-game buildings, especially Harbours.
*   **Price Ratio:** The Harbour has a price ratio of 1.15.

### Primary Function: Resource Storage

Harbours are categorized as general storage buildings designed to increase the maximum capacity of numerous common and uncommon resources:

| Resource | Storage Increase per Harbour |
| :--- | :--- |
| Catnip | +2,500 |
| Wood | +700 |
| Minerals | +950 |
| Iron | +150 |
| Coal | +100 |
| Gold | +25 |
| Titanium | +50 |

### Scaling and Upgrades

The effectiveness of Harbours can be enhanced through various Workshop and technology upgrades:

*   **Trade Ship Capacity Bonus (Expanded Cargo):** The [Expanded Cargo]( {{< relref "upgrade/Expanded_Cargo.md" >}}) upgrade, unlocked by [Navigation]( {{< relref "techs/Navigation.md" >}}), grants a bonus of **+1% to Harbour capacity per Trade Ship**. This bonus is subject to diminishing returns past 168.75% and is capped at 225%.
*   **Reactor Capacity Boost (Reactor Vessel):** The [Reactor Vessel]( {{< relref "upgrade/Reactor_Vessel.md" >}}) upgrade increases the Expanded Cargo limit by **+5% per Reactor**.
*   **Coal Storage (Barges):** The [Barges]( {{< relref "upgrade/Barges.md" >}}) upgrade increases the maximum [Coal]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}) storage provided by Harbours by **50%**.
*   **General Storage Upgrades:** Harbours also benefit from global storage upgrades initially designed for Barns and Warehouses, such as [Expanded Barns]( {{< relref "upgrade/Expanded_Barns.md" >}}), [Reinforced Barns]( {{< relref "upgrade/Reinforced_Barns.md" >}}), [Titanium Barns]( {{< relref "upgrade/Titanium_Barns.md" >}}), [Alloy Barns]( {{< relref "upgrade/Alloy_Barns.md" >}}), and [Concrete Barns]( {{< relref "upgrade/Concrete_Barns.md" >}}), which increase the storage capacity for wood, minerals, and iron.

### Strategic Role

Harbours are vital for maintaining economic momentum in the mid-game:

*   **Resource Management:** They address the strategic need to increase resource storage limits (or "caps"). If progress is stalled because resource storage limits are too low, building storage buildings like Harbours is necessary.
*   **Progression Path:** The early policy choice [Clear Cutting]( {{< relref "Policy/Clear_Cutting.md" >}}) is recommended because the resulting wood production boost is crucial for constructing Harbours, Observatories, and Trade Ships.
*   **Titanium Buff:** Harbours are among the structures that provide an early boost to [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) storage capacity, which is necessary before more advanced storage options become available.
