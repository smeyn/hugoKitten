The [Ivory Citadel]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Ivory_Citadel.md" >}}) is an advanced building within the Unicorn religious progression, critical for scaling late-game luxury resource production.

### Building Details and Effects

The Ivory Citadel is unlocked after constructing at least one [Ivory Tower]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Ivory_Tower.md" >}}) [1].

*   **Cost:** Building an Ivory Citadel requires **50 Tears** and **50,000 Ivory** [1].
*   **Effect on Unicorns:** It significantly improves unicorn generation by **+25%** [1].
*   **Ivory Generation:** The Ivory Citadel enables a random event called **Ivory Meteors**, which generate ivory [1]. The frequency of this event increases by 0.05% per game-day for each Ivory Citadel [1].

### Strategic Context

The Ivory Citadel sits on the path toward the most powerful religious buildings, playing a key role in setting up the **Unicorn/Time Crystal Era**:

1.  **Religious Progression:** The Ivory Citadel is a prerequisite for constructing the [Sky Palace]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Sky_Palace.md" >}}) [1].
2.  **Unicorn Economy:** In the late game, the overall religious path relies on generating Unicorns, which are then sacrificed to produce [Tears]( {{< relref "resource/tears.md" >}}) [2, 3]. Tears are then refined into Black Liquid Sorrow (BLS) to produce [Black Pyramids]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Black_Pyramid.md" >}}), which unlock Leviathan trade [4-6].
3.  **Ivory Source:** Strategically, Ivory Citadels are built primarily because they provide a valuable, passive, AFK source of **ivory** via the Ivory Meteor event [1, 7]. Ivory is a necessary resource for trading with the [Nagas]( {{< relref "trade/Nagas.md" >}}) for minerals [8, 9] and is also needed to construct further unicorn production buildings [10]. In runs focused on maximizing ivory returns early, the strategy recommends building as many Ivory Citadels as possible before moving on to higher-tier buildings like Sky Palaces, Unicorn Utopias, and Sunspires [7].
