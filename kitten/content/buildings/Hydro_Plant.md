The [Hydro Plant]( {{< relref "buildings/Hydro_Plant.md" >}}) is an advanced energy-generating structure in *Kittens Game* that is designed to replace the earlier catnip-boosting [Aqueduct]( {{< relref "buildings/Aqueduct.md" >}}) building.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Hydro Plant, its costs, effects, and strategic considerations:

### Acquisition and Cost

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** The Hydro Plant is unlocked by researching [Robotics]( {{< relref "techs/Robotics.md" >}}). Robotics requires 140K Science and 80 Blueprints.
*   **Resource Cost:** Building a Hydro Plant is resource-intensive, requiring advanced materials: **100 Concrete** and **2500 Titanium**. It has a price ratio of 1.15.
*   **Upgrade Path:** The Hydro Plant is classified as an upgraded building that supersedes the Aqueduct.

### Effects and Upgrades

*   **Energy Production:** Each Hydro Plant provides **+5 Energy**.
*   **Upgrades:** The [Hydro Plant Turbines]( {{< relref "upgrade/Hydro_Plant_Turbines.md" >}}) upgrade enhances its effectiveness, increasing Hydro Plant energy production by **+15%** (raising output from 5Wt to 5.75Wt). This upgrade costs 250k Science and 125 Unobtainium.
*   **Policy Interaction:** The Lizard Relations: Ecologists policy is affected by the number of active Hydro Plants, allowing some Magnetos to still boost resource production even when turned off.

### Strategic Considerations for Conversion

Upgrading Aqueducts to Hydro Plants represents a crucial transition from basic resource augmentation to industrial power generation. This decision carries significant risk:

1.  **Risk of Starvation:** Aqueducts provide a direct percentage boost to catnip production. Demolishing Aqueducts carelessly can **"very quickly put you in a starvation situation"**.
2.  **Resource Bottleneck:** You should **wait until you have good titanium production** before beginning this transition, as Hydro Plants cost a fair amount of titanium.
3.  **Optimal Timing:** The upgrade should be performed **when you need Energy more than you need catnip**. The strategic goal is to repurpose land previously devoted to marginal catnip bonuses for energy generation, which powers structures that offer stronger global scaling. Pastures are considered much safer to upgrade (to Solar Farms) than Aqueducts, as Pastures' food demand reduction is subject to strict diminishing returns.

### Late Game Importance

Hydro Plants, along with Sunlifters and Reactors, are a **main focus** for power generation in the late game. They are also counted among the list of energy production buildings required to complete the **Energy Challenge**.
