The **Barn** is a crucial early-to-mid-game storage building in *Kittens Game*, designed to increase resource storage limits, particularly for Catnip, which helps in managing seasonal challenges.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Barn:

### 1. Construction and Unlocks

*   **Technology Prerequisite:** The Barn building is unlocked by researching **Agriculture**.
*   **Cost:** The base cost to build one Barn is **50 Wood**.
*   **Price Ratio:** The Barn has a price ratio of **1.75**.

### 2. Core Function and Storage Capacity

Barns primarily serve to increase the maximum storage capacity for fundamental resources. Increasing storage maximums (caps) is cited as the **second most important thing** in the game, preventing progress walls when resources exceed storage limits.

A single Barn provides the following storage increases:

| Resource | Maximum Storage Increase per Barn |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Catnip** | **+5000** |
| **Wood** | **+200** |
| **Minerals** | **+250** |
| **Iron** | **+50** |
| **Coal** | **+60** |
| **Gold** | **+10** |
| **Titanium** | **+2** |

### 3. Strategic Importance

*   **Winter Survival:** The major increase in Catnip storage provided by Barns makes **surviving Winters** (when Catnip production nosedives by up to -75% or -90% in a Cold Winter) significantly easier, helping to prevent kittens from starving.
*   **Early Game Priority:** Unlocking Agriculture and then purchasing Barns is essential to quickly establish a strong economic foundation. They are classified as general storage buildings that should be built "as needed".
*   **Resource Rotation:** In the Basic Resource Rotation (BRR), after capping Catnip fields, players are advised to focus on "wood only buildings," which includes Barns.

### 4. Upgrades and Storage Synergy

Barns benefit from several workshop upgrades, many of which apply across multiple storage structures (Barns, Warehouses, and Harbors):

*   **Direct Capacity Increases:**
    *   **Expanded Barns:** Increases max storage for Wood, Minerals, and Iron by **75%**.
    *   **Reinforced Barns:** Increases max storage for Wood, Minerals, and Iron by **80%**.
    *   **Titanium Barns** and **Alloy Barns:** Each increase max storage for Wood, Minerals, and Iron by **100%**.
    *   **Concrete Barns:** Increases max storage for Wood, Minerals, and Iron by **75%**.
*   **General Storage Upgrades:** Barns also benefit from upgrades that apply broadly to common resource storage across multiple buildings, such as **Reinforced Warehouses**, **Titanium Warehouses**, **Alloy Warehouses**, and **Concrete Warehouses**.
*   **Concrete Pillars:** This upgrade increases the maximum storage for Wood, Minerals, and Iron from Barns and Warehouses by **5%**. It also applies a 5% bonus to max Coal, Gold, and Titanium storage from Barns and other facilities.
*   **Silos Synergy:** Although Warehouses are the only building that can directly store Catnip via the **Silos** upgrade, once Silos is researched, all storage upgrades with "barns" in their name apply **25% of their effect to maximum Catnip** storage as well.
