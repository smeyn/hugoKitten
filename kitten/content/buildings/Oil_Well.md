The [Oil Well]( {{< relref "oil_well.md" >}}) is a significant resource-producing building in *Kittens Game*, marking a progression into the era of advanced fuel and energy infrastructure.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the Oil Well based on the sources:

### 1. Construction and Unlocks

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** The Oil Well building is unlocked by researching the [Chemistry]( {{< relref "chemistry.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Cost:** The base cost to construct an Oil Well is **50 Steel, 25 Gears, and 25 Scaffold**.
*   **Energy Consumption:** Once the [Pumpjack]( {{< relref "pumpjack.md" >}}) upgrade is applied, the Oil Well consumes **1 Energy** per tick to operate.

### 2. Purpose and Production

The Oil Well's primary function is to introduce and produce **Oil**, which is crucial for subsequent advanced crafting and energy production.

*   **Output:** The Oil Well produces **+0.02 Oil per Tick**.
*   **Storage:** Each Oil Well provides **+1500 Max Oil** capacity.

Oil is classified as a Common Resource, produced by Oil Wells or refined from catnip by upgraded Bio Labs. Oil is vital for constructing Calciners and is later processed into [Kerosene]( {{< relref "resource/kerosene.md" >}}), a rocket fuel.

### 3. Upgrades and Strategic Importance

Oil Wells are critical, as Oil quickly becomes a bottleneck resource during the transition to space exploration.

The output of Oil Wells can be boosted by several Workshop upgrades:

| Upgrade Name | Effect | Prerequisite |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Pumpjack]( {{< relref "pumpjack.md" >}}) | Improves effectiveness by **+45%** (additive with other effects). Also adds automation and causes the Oil Well to consume 1 Energy. | Mechanization. |
| [Oil Refinery]( {{< relref "oil_refinery.md" >}}) | Improves effectiveness by **+35%**. | Combustion. |
| [Oil Distillation]( {{< relref "oil_distillation.md" >}}) | Output is improved by **+75%**. | Rocketry. |

The need for Oil Wells is frequently emphasized:

*   **Early Space Era:** In the pre-Metaphysics, "early Space" phase, **Oil is slow to produce**, making it necessary to build Oil Wells quickly and let them "fill up" their production/storage.
*   **Grinding:** Grinding out the necessary [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/steel.md" >}}) for Oil Wells is recommended over relying on Tankers for storage cap increases.
*   **Coal Management:** When grinding **coal for Oil Wells**, players are advised to turn off Steamworks or anything else consuming coal to maximize the available coal.
*   **Overbuilding:** Players should build **more Oil Wells than they initially need** to help increase the oil production rate.

### 4. Policy Connection

The [Full Industrialization]( {{< relref "full_industrialization.md" >}}) policy, which becomes available after researching Industrialization and choosing either Strip Mining or Clear Cutting, boosts the production of Iron, Coal, and [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}). Although it doesn't directly boost the Oil Well, it is generally preferred over Sustainability in runs where many factories (which consume Oil indirectly via Kerosene crafting) are built.
