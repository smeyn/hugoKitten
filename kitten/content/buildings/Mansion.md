The [Mansion]( {{< relref "buildings/Mansion.md" >}}) is a high-tier housing structure in *Kittens Game*, succeeding the Hut and Log House, and is essential for maximizing your kitten population in the later stages of the game.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Mansion:

### Unlocking and Cost

The Mansion becomes available after reaching the mid-game architectural stage of development.

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** Mansions are unlocked by researching [Architecture]( {{< relref "techs/Architecture.md" >}}). Architecture costs **42,000 Science** and **10 Compendiums**, and is unlocked after Navigation.
*   **Resource Cost:** Constructing a Mansion requires advanced, processed materials:
    *   **Slab:** 185 units
    *   [Steel:]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) 75 units
    *   [Titanium:]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) 25 units
*   **Price Ratio:** The Mansion has a price ratio of 1.15.

### Effects and Function

As a population building, the Mansion contributes to increasing your workforce capacity.

*   **Maximum Kittens:** Each Mansion increases the maximum number of Kittens by **+1**.
*   **Maximum Catpower:** Each Mansion increases the maximum Catpower storage by **+50**.

### Strategic Role

The ability to build Mansions signifies entry into the mid-game where titanium and processed goods are necessary, and they are critical for population-based prestige farming.

*   **Population Expansion:** Mansions provide housing for **more kittens**, which is necessary since population acts as a **"THE global modifier"** in the early game and remains a factor later on.
*   **Late-Game Housing Priority:** In rapid paragon grinding runs, particularly after multiple resets, players are advised to focus on building Space Stations, Mansions, Log Houses, and Huts to accommodate incoming kittens as fast as they arrive. They are considered key components for maximizing population alongside Huts and Log Houses.
*   **Policy Interaction:** Mansions are included in the calculation for the [Autocracy]( {{< relref "policies/Autocracy.md" >}}) government policy. The Autocracy leader's conversion production bonus on Cath is based on the number of **uncapped population buildings** (Huts, Log Houses, Mansions) for which the player has enough storage space to build more.
