The [Amphitheatre]( {{< relref "buildings/Amphitheatre.md" >}}) is an important early-to-mid-game building in *Kittens Game*, crucial for managing kitten happiness and initiating [Culture]( {{< relref "resource/culture.md" >}}) production, which is vital for later scientific and religious progression.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the Amphitheatre:

### Unlocking and Cost

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** The Amphitheatre is unlocked after researching [Writing]( {{< relref "techs/Writing.md" >}}). Writing costs **3600 Science** and is unlocked by [Engineering]( {{< relref "techs/Engineering.md" >}}).
*   **Resource Cost:** Constructing an Amphitheatre requires a mix of common and crafted resources:
    *   **Wood:** 200 units
    *   **Minerals:** 1200 units
    *   [Parchment:]( {{< relref "craft/Parchment.md" >}}) 3 units (Parchment is a craftable resource made from Furs)
*   **Price Ratio:** The Amphitheatre has a price ratio of 1.15.

### Effects and Function

The Amphitheatre serves two critical functions for societal development: culture production and unhappiness mitigation.

*   **Culture Production:** Each Amphitheatre produces **+0.005 Culture per Tick**. Culture is a special resource necessary to convert Parchment into [Manuscripts]( {{< relref "craft/Manuscript.md" >}}) in the Workshop.
*   **Culture Storage:** Each Amphitheatre increases the maximum [Culture]( {{< relref "resource/culture.md" >}}) storage capacity by **+50**.
*   **Happiness/Unhappiness:** Amphitheatres reduce population penalties to happiness, providing **-4.8% Unhappiness** mitigation.

### Strategic Importance

The decision to build Amphitheatres is a major early-game strategic step, as it addresses a key bottleneck in the technology tree:

*   **Culture Grind:** Amphitheatres are one of the earliest buildings to generate [Culture]( {{< relref "resource/culture.md" >}}). Culture is required to craft [Manuscripts]( {{< relref "craft/Manuscript.md" >}}), which are necessary to research [Theology]( {{< relref "science/theology.md" >}}) and subsequent high-tier sciences like [Astronomy]( {{< relref "techs/Astronomy.md" >}}). This resource requirement creates a significant hurdle, forcing players to focus on culture generation.
*   **Managing Population Happiness:** As your kitten population grows (by building Huts and Log Houses, which you should keep maxed out), they become unhappy. Since **Happiness dictates the overall efficiency** of your Kittens in their work, Amphitheatres are extremely important in the early game to reduce unhappiness and maintain high production levels.
    *   It is advised to build Amphitheatres until they stop noticeably improving Happiness, which can be monitored via the 'population penalty' percentage on the top bar of the game.
*   **Preparation for Temples:** Amphitheatres help make obtaining [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}) easier, as Temples are another structure that generates Culture.
*   **Building Priority:** When happiness starts becoming a serious problem, players should consider pushing for the [Writing]( {{< relref "techs/Writing.md" >}}) science to unlock Amphitheatres. You may need to temporarily employ all kittens as Hunters to stockpile the [Parchment]( {{< relref "craft/Parchment.md" >}}) required to craft them.

### Upgrades and Progression

*   **Upgrade Path:** The Amphitheatre can be upgraded to a [Broadcast Tower]( {{< relref "buildings/Broadcast_Tower.md" >}}). This upgrade is unlocked by researching [Electronics]( {{< relref "techs/Electronics.md" >}}).
*   **Broadcast Tower Conversion:** The Broadcast Tower upgrade offers a significant boost to culture production and unhappiness reduction, with a single tower potentially replacing an entire stock of Amphitheatres for happiness purposes. A single tower increases the culture cap as much as six Amphitheatres, and increases culture production as much as **"two hundred"**. There is generally little reason to delay this upgrade once the metal is available to build a tower.
*   **Alternative Culture Buildings:** Culture can also be generated by [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}) and [Chapels]( {{< relref "buildings/Chapel.md" >}}).
