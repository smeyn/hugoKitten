A Pasture is an early-game food production building in *Kittens Game* that helps reduce your civilization's Catnip consumption rate.

Here is a breakdown of the Pasture:

### Functionality and Benefits

*   **Primary Effect:** The Pasture decreases the amount of Catnip required by each Kitten, specifically reducing Catnip Demand by **0.5%**. This reduction helps kittens survive, especially during Winter when Catnip production nosedives.
*   **Cost:** A Pasture costs **100 Catnip** and **10 Wood** to construct, and its price ratio increases by 1.15 for each subsequent purchase.
*   **Prerequisite:** Pastures are unlocked after you research the **Animal Husbandry** technology. Animal Husbandry itself is unlocked after researching Archery.

### Relation to Catnip Survival

In the early game, surviving Winter can be challenging because Catnip Field production decreases by 75% in Winter (and 90% in a Cold Winter).

*   While **Farmers** (unlocked by Agriculture) are essential because their Catnip accumulation is *not* subject to the effects of Winter, Pastures provide a vital complementary benefit by lowering the overall Catnip needed by your growing population.
*   Acquiring Pastures, along with increasing your Catnip Fields and constructing Barns (which boost Catnip storage capacity), is crucial for maintaining a healthy and productive population during resource-scarce seasons.

### Upgrades and Achievements

*   **Upgrade Path:** The Pasture (indicated by the ∧ symbol) can be upgraded to a **Solar Farm** after researching the **Ecology** technology. This upgrade is generally performed when you need **Energy** more than you need Catnip, but it means you lose the Pasture's food bonus.
*   **Achievements:** Building 45 Pastures is associated with an achievement, although Pastures are considered "useless" in the specific context of the **Iron Will** challenge.

### Unicorn Pastures (Related Building)

The **Unicorn Pasture** is a separate, related building that also reduces Catnip Demand.

*   **Acquisition:** You must first find two **Unicorns** (which have a 5% chance of being gathered during a Hunt) to create a Unicorn Pasture.
*   **Effect:** A Unicorn Pasture costs 2 Unicorns and has a price ratio of 1.75. Its primary effect is reducing Catnip Demand by **0.15%** and automatically generating more Unicorns.
*   **Long-Term Benefit:** Unicorn Pastures are handy in the long run because they further reduce the amount of Catnip consumed by each Kitten.
