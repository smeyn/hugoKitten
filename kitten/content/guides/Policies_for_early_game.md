+++

The policies available early in *Kittens Game* are crucial for optimizing resource accumulation, accelerating the cultural and scientific development required to reach later phases, and preparing for the first major reset (Phase 1/2: Village, Order of the Sun, chasing Paragon).

The overall strategy in the early game is to maximize global production through **kittens and happiness**, while overcoming specific resource bottlenecks like wood and manuscripts.

Here are the recommended policy choices during early game cycles, generally unlocked after researching Engineering:

### 1. Environment Policies

| Policy Choice | Rationale & Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Clear Cutting]( {{< relref "policies/Clear_Cutting.md" >}}) | [Clear Cutting]( {{< relref "policies/Clear_Cutting.md" >}}) is highly recommended over its alternatives. |
| | It provides a substantial **+30% wood production** bonus. |
| | This boost is critical because wood becomes a "huge help" for constructing major mid-game buildings, such as **observatories, harbours, and ships** (required after researching Navigation). |
| | *Note:* Although it introduces a small penalty of -2% happiness and +5% pollution, the resource gain outweighs these drawbacks during this developmental phase. The alternative, [Environmentalism]( {{< relref "policies/Environmentalism.md" >}}), is considered "pretty weak and doesn't do much for you".|

### 2. Government Policies (Tier 1: Unlocked by Writing)

| Policy Choice | Rationale & Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Tradition]( {{< relref "policies/Tradition.md" >}}) | [Tradition]( {{< relref "policies/Tradition.md" >}}) is generally preferred. |
| | This policy accelerates the essential **manuscript grind** required to advance the science tree (especially toward Theology and Astronomy). |
| | It reduces the manuscript cost ($-100$ culture and $-5$ parchment) and **doubles the manuscript maximum culture effect**. |
| | *Note:* While [Liberty]( {{< relref "policies/Liberty.md" >}}) increases the production effect of happiness, experts favour Tradition for accelerating the major cultural bottleneck. For early runs where unhappiness is a major factor, some players might consider Liberty to offset the production hit, but typically suggest switching to Tradition later. |

### 3. Government Policies (Tier 2: Unlocked by Writing + Prior Policy)

| Policy Choice | Rationale & Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Monarchy]( {{< relref "policies/Monarchy.md" >}}) | [Monarchy]( {{< relref "policies/Monarchy.md" >}}) is considered an "AMAZING" choice due to its flexibility and scaling potential. |
| | It makes the **leader's trait twice as powerful**. For example, a Leader with the Artisan trait will gain a +10% craft ratio instead of +5% (ignoring other bonuses). |
| | This is powerful because a highly promoted leader can provide a massive boost to whatever resource is currently bottlenecking production, such as wood, science, or crafting efficiency. |
| | *Contrast:* Alternatives like [Republic]( {{< relref "policies/Republic.md" >}}) and [Autocracy]( {{< relref "policies/Autocracy.md" >}}) offer small bonuses that are generally dwarfed by Monarchy's multiplicative leader effect. |

### 4. Philosophy Policies (Unlocked by Philosophy)

| Policy Choice | Rationale & Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Epicureanism** | **Epicureanism** is often preferred because it focuses on boosting overall production. |
| | Luxury resources (Furs, Ivory, Spice) will provide **11% happiness** instead of the base 10%. Higher happiness is critical for increasing kitten productivity across all jobs. |
| | By the time this policy is reached, trade and hunting systems should be robust enough to manage luxury consumption, making [Stoicism]( {{< relref "policies/Stoicism.md" >}}) (which halves consumption) less necessary. |

### 5. Foreign Policies (Unlocked by Currency)

| Policy Choice | Rationale & Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "policies/Diplomacy.md" >}}) | [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "policies/Diplomacy.md" >}}) is a standard early pick in the Foreign tree. |
| | Each trade costs **5 less Catpower**. Catpower is a foundational resource needed for hunting, exploration, and trade. |
| | Furthermore, choosing Diplomacy leads to the subsequent policy [Cultural Exchange]( {{< relref "policies/Cultural_Exchange.md" >}}), which boosts culture income. |

In summary, for early game cycles, the optimal choices centre on [Clear Cutting]( {{< relref "policies/Clear_Cutting.md" >}}) (for wood/infrastructure), [Tradition]( {{< relref "policies/Tradition.md" >}}) (for manuscript/science velocity), and **Monarchy/Epicureanism** (for maximizing kitten production via happiness and leader efficiency).
