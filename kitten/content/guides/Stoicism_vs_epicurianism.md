+++

The policies of Stoicism and Epicureanism represent two distinct philosophical approaches available to your kittens' civilization, primarily impacting the management of **luxury resources** and [Happiness]( {{< relref "guides/Happiness.md" >}}). These choices, unlocked after researching [Philosophy]( {{< relref "science/Philosophy.md" >}}), determine subsequent policy options in the Philosophy category.

Here is a comparison of the two policies based on the source material:

### Stoicism

The Stoicism policy focuses on endurance and restraint regarding consumption.

*   **Description:** The stoics teach that your civilization ought to endure hardship without complaint.
*   **Effect:** Stoicism **halves the consumption of luxury resources**. Luxury resources include Furs, Ivory, and Spice.
*   **Other Impact:** It also introduces a **-25% reduction in Brewery consumption**.
*   **Subsequent Policies:** Stoicism leads to [Frugality]( {{< relref "policies/Frugality.md" >}}) and [Rationing]( {{< relref "policies/Rationing.md" >}}) policies.
    *   [Frugality]( {{< relref "policies/Frugality.md" >}}) improves Mints' resource production by 10%.
    *   [Rationing]( {{< relref "policies/Rationing.md" >}}) makes hunting more effective (+0.1 Hunting bonus) and reduces the catnip consumption increase per happiness by 10%.

### Epicureanism

Epicureanism emphasizes pleasure as the highest good, leveraging luxury resources for increased satisfaction and production bonuses.

*   **Description:** Epicureans believe that pleasure is the highest good.
*   **Effect:** Luxury resources provide **slightly more happiness**, increasing the bonus from 10% to **11% each**.
*   **Subsequent Policies:** Epicureanism leads to [Carnivale]( {{< relref "policies/Carnivale.md" >}}) and [Extravagance]( {{< relref "policies/Extravagance.md" >}}) policies.
    *   [Extravagance]( {{< relref "policies/Extravagance.md" >}}) triples luxury consumption (200% increase) but dramatically boosts happiness derived from consumable resources to 5 (instead of 11%).
    *   [Carnivale]( {{< relref "policies/Carnivale.md" >}}) boosts kitten arrival speed during festivals (30% increase) but also increases luxury consumption during them (30% increase).

### Strategic Considerations

Guidance from experts in the sources suggests that the preferred choice often depends on the state of your resource production:

*   **Epicureanism (Epi) is generally preferred** because the extra happiness provides an overall production boost. Happiness dictates the overall efficiency of your Kittens in their work; the happier they are, the better the results of their labor.
*   By the time this policy is unlocked, players should ideally have established robust **Hunting** operations and sufficient [Tradeposts]( {{< relref "buildings/Tradepost.md" >}}) to slow down the consumption of luxury items, reducing the need for the consumption mitigation offered by Stoicism.
*   **Stoicism (and its associated policies) is considered** if you are struggling to keep up with luxury resource demands. If consumption is outpacing a fully upgraded hunting team and tradepost effects, Stoicism, or its subsequent policies like Rationing, may be necessary to control costs and maintain happiness levels.

In short, **Epicureanism favours maximising output via happiness**, while **Stoicism favours optimising input via consumption reduction**.
