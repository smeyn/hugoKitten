In *Kittens Game*, [arbitrage]( {{< relref "guides/arbitrage.md" >}}) refers to the strategic manipulation of resource conversion and trading cycles to generate a net profit or bypass severe production bottlenecks. Rather than relying on linear accumulation, players use arbitrage to transform high-volume, low-value resources into restricted, high-value capital.

### **Key Arbitrage Strategies**

| Strategy | Mechanism | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trade Arbitrage** | Refining **Catnip** into **Wood** and immediately trading it to [Griffins]( {{< relref "trade/Griffins.md" >}}). | Resolving the mid-game **Iron** bottleneck by bypassing slow smelters. |
| **Iron Will (IW) Loop** | Trading **Iron** to [Sharks]( {{< relref "trade/Sharks.md" >}}) for **Catnip**, refining it to **Wood**, and trading that back to [Griffins]( {{< relref "trade/Griffins.md" >}}) for **Iron**. | Generating a net profit of Iron and Wood in resource-constrained IW runs. |
| **Temporal Arbitrage** | Shattering [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}) to skip less productive years and land on the [Redmoon]( {{< relref "planet/Redmoon.md" >}}) cycle. | Converting temporal capital into a $2.5\times$ spike in [Unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}}) production. |
| **Positive Resets** | Building enough [Chronospheres]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}) to carry over more resources than were spent during the run. | Establishing a self-sustaining engine of exponential growth. |

### **Detailed Arbitrage Mechanics**

#### **1. Mid-Game Trade Arbitrage**
The raw production rates of base resources often become the primary bottleneck for industrial expansion. To solve this, players use the **Catnip $\to$ Wood $\to$ Iron** loop. This system exploits the high volume of catnip to create wood, which is then traded to the Griffins for Iron. This "trade arbitrage" effectively turns food production into high-value industrial metal, which is much faster than waiting for standard Smelters or Calciners to process ore.

#### **2. Temporal and Cycle Arbitrage**
In the late game, the focus shifts to system [arbitrage]( {{< relref "guides/arbitrage.md" >}}). Because the [Redmoon]( {{< relref "planet/Redmoon.md" >}}) cycle provides a massive multiplier to Unobtainium production, players use [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}) as a currency to "buy" more productive time. 
*   By skipping the "fallow" years of other cycles, players ensure their Outposts and Space Elevators are always operating at maximum efficiency.
*   When combined with [Numeromancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/numeromancy.md" >}}) and active **Festivals**, this temporal arbitrage generates the massive amounts of Unobtainium required for endgame goals.

#### **3. Positive Chrono-Reset Arbitrage**
The ultimate goal of endgame optimization is the **positive reset**. This occurs when your storage capacity for Unobtainium is high enough (at least **8.14 billion**) to build **73 or more Chronospheres**. 
*   At **73 Chronospheres**, the amount of resources carried over into the next game exceeds the cost of building those spheres.
*   This transforms expendable resources into **compounding capital**, meaning every reset starts the player with an exponentially larger foundation than the previous run.

### **Strategic Recommendation**
Successful progression requires moving away from linear growth and toward these geometric scaling loops. Are you currently hitting a specific resource wall—such as **Iron** or [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}})—where a trade-based arbitrage loop might help you progress faster than your current buildings allow?
