**Iron Will (IW)** is a specialised gameplay mode in *Kittens Game* where the colony operates without any kitten housing or population. Entering this mode requires resetting the game with **zero Chronospheres** and avoiding the construction of Huts, Log Houses, or Mansions; building any housing immediately exits the mode.

### **The Zebra Accumulation Loop**
The primary engine of an Iron Will run is the **Zebra**, which replaces kittens as hunters and provides **Catpower**. 
*   **Initial Discovery:** Zebras begin to appear only after researching [Archery]( {{< relref "techs/Archery.md" >}}).
*   **Zebra Farming Strategy:** To build a viable foundation, players should research Archery and then **immediately reset**. Each reset performed after reaching Archery in IW increases the maximum Zebra limit for the next run by one.
*   **The 50–60 Zebra Target:** Strategic guides recommend repeating this "Archery reset" loop 6 to 10 times to accumulate **50–60 Zebras**. This provides a permanent, efficient Catpower source that bypasses the need for food management, significantly accelerating mid-game economic stability.

### **Early Infrastructure and Science**
Without kittens to assign as Scholars or Farmers, resource acquisition and research are fundamentally altered:
*   **Science Generation:** Initial science is gained exclusively through **astronomical events**, which are unlocked by building **Libraries**. Since manual observation is required early on, the automatic success chance is set to a flat **25%** in IW mode.
*   **Mineral Acquisition:** Minerals are obtained via **meteors**, with the yield increasing for every [Mine]( {{< relref "buildings/Mine.md" >}}) built.
*   **Scientific Prioritisation:** Research [Mathematics]( {{< relref "techs/Mathematics.md" >}}) early to unlock [Celestial Mechanics]( {{< relref "upgrade/Celestial_Mechanics.md" >}}), which provides a **60% boost** to science gained from events and meteors in IW. Avoid job-specific upgrades like Mineral Hoes or Iron Axes, as they have no effect without workers.

### **Mid-Game Progression and Bottlenecks**
The transition to space and high-tier industry is gated by specific IW constraints:
*   **The Culture Cap:** To progress, you must discover the [Nagas]( {{< relref "trade/Nagas.md" >}}) to trade for minerals. This requires a **1,500 culture cap**, which is achieved by building Amphitheatres, Academies, and crafting Manuscripts.
*   **Gold and Ivory:** Gold is obtained solely through **hunting** until Geodesy is researched. Ivory is also sourced from hunting and is essential for building the "Unicorn Tree".
*   **Trade Arbitrage:** Use the **Shark and Griffin loop** to bypass early production limits. Trade iron to Sharks for Catnip, refine it into Wood, and trade Wood to Griffins for more Iron.
*   **Policy Selection:** In IW, [Clear Cutting]( {{< relref "Policy/Clear_Cutting.md" >}}) (+10% catnip refinement) and [Strip Mining]( {{< relref "Policy/Strip_Mining.md" >}}) (+10% meteor minerals) provide specialised benefits.

### **Prestige and Endgame IW Goals**
Significant milestones like the **"Space Oddity"** (reaching space in IW) or the **"Cathammer 40k"** (staying in IW for 40,000 years) require substantial preparation:
*   **Paragon and Metaphysics:** It is highly recommended to have **400+ burnt paragon** and all **Metaphysics price reduction upgrades** (Golden Ratio, etc.) before a serious long-term IW run. Burnt paragon is particularly valuable as it provides a production and storage boost that works within IW.
*   **Oil Cap Management:** Reaching the high oil storage required for space missions is a major hurdle. Strategies suggest **grinding steel for Oil Wells** rather than relying on expensive Tankers.
*   **Religious Utility:** Pursuing **Unicorn Religion** is beneficial as **Ivory Meteors** (unlocked via Ivory Citadels) provide an automated source of ivory, reducing the reliance on active hunting for trades. Reaching **Transcendence Tier 15** for [Blazars]( {{< relref "transcendence/Blazar.md" >}}) is a common endgame goal to stabilise Time Crystal production.
