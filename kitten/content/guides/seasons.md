In *Kittens Game*, [Seasons]( {{< relref "guides/seasons.md" >}}) are a core cyclical mechanic that dictates the efficiency of your resource production, particularly **catnip**, and influences the success of trade with other civilisations.

### **The Seasonal Cycle**
Each year consists of four seasons: **Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter**. 
*   **Duration:** Each season lasts **100 days**, which equates to 1,000 game ticks or approximately **3 minutes and 20 seconds** in real-time.
*   [Calendar:]( {{< relref "techs/Calendar.md" >}}) The progression of seasons is hidden until you research the [Calendar]( {{< relref "techs/Calendar.md" >}}) technology (30 Science).

### **Catnip Production and Survival**
The primary impact of seasons is on [Catnip Fields]( {{< relref "buildings/Catnip_Field.md" >}}), which receive a production boost in Spring and a massive penalty in Winter.

| Season | Catnip Multiplier (Average Weather) | Impact on Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spring** | **+50%** | Best time to expand your population and build up stocks. |
| **Summer** | **+0%** | Standard production; a good time to focus on non-food resources. |
| **Autumn** | **+0%** | Focus on accumulating large catnip reserves for the coming cold. |
| **Winter** | **-75%** | Production nosedives; kittens are at high risk of **starvation**. |

**Key Exception:** [Farmers]( {{< relref "job/Farmer.md" >}}) are vital because their catnip production is **not affected** by seasonal modifiers. Reallocating kittens to the Farmer job during Winter is a standard survival tactic.

### **Weather Variations**
Starting in **Year 4**, seasons have a **35% chance** to be "abnormal"—either **Warm** or **Cold**. This adds a further modifier to your catnip fields:
*   **Warm Weather:** Provides an additional boost (e.g., Spring becomes **+65%**).
*   **Cold Weather:** Makes penalties harsher (e.g., Winter drops to **-90%**). 

The [Communism]( {{< relref "Policy/Communism.md" >}}) policy makes cold winters even more dangerous by setting catnip field production to **-100%**.

### **Seasonal Trade Strategy**
Different races offer better deals or different resource amounts depending on the time of year.

*   **Spring:** The best time to trade with [Nagas]( {{< relref "trade/Nagas.md" >}}) for Minerals (+25%).
*   **Summer:** [Lizards]( {{< relref "trade/Lizards.md" >}}) provide a +35% bonus to Wood.
*   **Autumn:** [Griffins]( {{< relref "trade/Griffins.md" >}}) are most efficient, providing +35% Iron.
*   **Winter:** [Sharks]( {{< relref "trade/Sharks.md" >}}) are the MVP of Winter, providing a **+45% bonus** to Catnip, which can be refined into Wood to survive the season.

### **Advanced Seasonal Mechanics**
*   **Energy Generation:** [Solar Farms]( {{< relref "buildings/Solar_Farm.md" >}}) are more efficient in Summer (+2.67 Energy) than in Winter (+1.5 Energy). 
*   **Space Production:** Once **Numerology** is researched, different years in a 10-year **Cycle** (like Redmoon or Helios) provide additional multipliers to space resources.
*   **"Winter Has Come" Challenge:** This challenge forces the game into a permanent, endless Winter, requiring players to rely entirely on Farmers for food.
