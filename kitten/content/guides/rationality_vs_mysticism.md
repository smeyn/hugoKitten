+++

The conflict between [Rationality]( {{< relref "Policy/Rationality.md" >}}) and [Mysticism]( {{< relref "Policy/Mysticism.md" >}}) is presented in *Kittens Game* as a choice between two philosophical **Policy/** that offer distinct bonuses to your production. You may only select one of these options, and your choice impacts the resources you prioritise.

### Policy Comparison

| Policy | Prerequisite | Cost (Culture) | Effect | Strategic Assessment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Rationality]( {{< relref "Policy/Rationality.md" >}}) | Stoicism or Epicureanism | 3000 | +5% science and iron production | Recommended to skip, as science is generally easy to get. |
| [Mysticism]( {{< relref "Policy/Mysticism.md" >}}) | Stoicism or Epicureanism | 3000 | +5% culture and faith production | Recommended to pick, as culture and faith accumulation is intrinsically slow. |

Both Policy/ are available after you have chosen between [Stoicism]( {{< relref "Policy/Stoicism.md" >}}) and **Epicureanism**.

### Strategic Implications

The choice between the two Policy/ is often straightforward, based on which resources present a greater long-term bottleneck:

1.  **Mysticism (Recommended Choice):** It is generally recommended to choose [Mysticism]( {{< relref "Policy/Mysticism.md" >}}).
    *   **Culture and Faith Bottleneck:** The primary reason is that [Faith]( {{< relref "resource/faith.md" >}}) and [Culture]( {{< relref "resource/culture.md" >}}) accumulation is notoriously slow in the game, particularly in the mid-game when these resources become necessary for advancements like [Theology]( {{< relref "science/theology.md" >}}) and Temple upgrades.
    *   **Maximising Production:** The $+5\%$ bonus provided by Mysticism is useful for accelerating the rate at which you can generate these inputs, helping to overcome the cultural hurdle.

2.  **Rationality (Generally Avoided):** The benefit offered by [Rationality]( {{< relref "Policy/Rationality.md" >}}) is often considered less valuable.
    *   **Science Accumulation:** Science is generally easy to acquire through dedicated Scholar kittens and scientific buildings (like Libraries and Academies), meaning the $+5\%$ science bonus is not needed as urgently as the boost to slower resources.
    *   **Iron Production:** While iron is a critical resource, boosting its production by $+5\%$ is less impactful than improving the speed of faith and culture generation, especially since iron can often be acquired efficiently through trade (e.g., trading wood to Griffins).
