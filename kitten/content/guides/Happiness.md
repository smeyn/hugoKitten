Happiness is a critical game mechanic that directly influences the productivity and overall efficiency of your Kittens in their work. The higher the level of happiness, the better the results of their labour.

However, happiness can become a hindrance, as it is considered a production killer until you have enough Amphitheaters. As the population grows, Kittens become unhappy, and this affects overall production.

### Sources and Effects of Happiness

#### Positive Sources (Boosts)

1.  Rare Resources: Rare resources (Furs, Ivory, and Spice) provide a happiness bonus. Hunting accumulates Furs and Ivory, which serves the purpose of increasing Happiness. Each rare resource, when consumed, gives +10% to happiness. Mints, which generate rare resources, also help boost happiness and therefore production. The Epicureanism policy can increase the happiness gained from rare resources to 11% each, and the Extravagance policy increases happiness from consumable luxury resources by 5.
2.  Karma: Karma, which is gained upon resetting the game (if you have more than 35 kittens), increases happiness, making your kittens happier and thus more productive.
3.  [Buildings]( {{< relref "buildings" >}}) and [Upgrades:]( {{< relref "upgrade" >}})
    *   [Amphitheatres]( {{< relref "amphitheatre" >}}) are crucial for the early game as they help reduce unhappiness caused by rising population.
    *   The religious upgrade [Sun Altar]( {{< relref "sun_altar.md" >}}) (unlocked via the Order of the Sun) provides +0.5% happiness from Temples, with additional levels available through Transcendence.
    *   Sacrificing unicorns for a unicorn tear grants a happiness/production bonus.
    *   A single [Broadcast Tower]( {{< relref "broadcast_tower.md" >}}) can replace your entire stock of Amphitheaters for happiness purposes.
4.  Policies and Policy Effects:
    *   The [Liberty]( {{< relref "liberty" >}}) policy increases the production effect of happiness by 10% and grants free housing for one kitten.
    *   The [Environmentalism]( {{< relref "environmentalism" >}}) policy provides a +3% happiness effect.
    *   The [Conservation]( {{< relref "conservation" >}}) policy increases happiness by +5%.
    *   The [Fascism]( {{< relref "fascism" >}}) policy eliminates population penalties to happiness.

#### Negative Sources (Penalties)

1.  Population Growth: As population rises, kittens become unhappy.
2.  Pollution: A high level of pollution in the atmosphere negatively affects your kittens and reduces your happiness.
3.  [Policies:]( {{< relref "policies" >}}) Certain policies increase happiness penalties, such as [Strip Mining]( {{< relref "strip_mining.md" >}}) and [Clear Cutting]( {{< relref "clear_cutting.md" >}}), which both incur a -2% happiness penalty. The [Sustainability]( {{< relref "sustainability" >}}) policy can be used later to remove this happiness penalty.
4.  Challenges:Running the Atheism challenge decreases happiness by 0.5 for each run completed after the first.

### Management

To maintain a healthy, productive population, it is crucial to keep your Happiness nice and high. Players are advised to build Amphitheatres until they stop noticeably improving Happiness, as monitored by the ‘population penalty’ percentage on the top bar of the game. Trade Depots decrease the consumption rate of rare resources (luxuries).
