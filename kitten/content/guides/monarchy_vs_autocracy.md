+++

Monarchy and Autocracy are both **Government Policy/** available in *Kittens Game*, costing **Culture 1500**. They occupy the same policy tier, meaning you can only choose one of the two for the current run, and the choice affects which Policy/ you can access later.

Here is a detailed comparison of the two Policy/:

### Monarchy

The Monarchy policy is generally highly recommended by expert advice for its substantial and flexible benefits.

| Aspect | Details | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | Culture 1500 | |
| **Prerequisites** | Must have researched [Writing]( {{< relref "techs/Writing.md" >}}) and chosen the [Tradition]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}) policy. | |
| **Core Effect (Trait)** | Makes the **leader's trait twice as powerful**. For example, the artisan bonus goes from 5% to 10%. | |
| **Drawback** | Maintaining the royal court **reduces gold production by 10%**. | |
| **Strategic Value** | Doubling the leader's effect is considered **"AMAZING"**. If you promote a leader to a high rank, this doubled trait bonus can be leveraged for various jobs, acting like getting 11 extra kittens gathering that resource (e.g., wood). | |
| **Next Tier Policy/**| Leads to a choice between [Liberalism]( {{< relref "Policy/Liberalism.md" >}}) and [Fascism]( {{< relref "Policy/Fascism.md" >}}) (once a Factory is built). | |

### Autocracy

The Autocracy policy is primarily focused on doubling the leader's raw production output, but is often considered less impactful than Monarchy.

| Aspect | Details | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | Culture 1500 | |
| **Prerequisites** | Must have researched [Writing]( {{< relref "techs/Writing.md" >}}) and chosen either the [Liberty]( {{< relref "Policy/Liberty.md" >}}) or [Tradition]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}) policy. | |
| **Core Effect (Production)** | Makes the **leader twice as good at their job**, doubling their production bonus. | |
| **Secondary Effect** | The leader's bonus also increases **conversion production** (resources produced by Smelters, Calciners, and Accelerators) based on leader rank and the count of uncapped housing buildings, specifically during the **Cath cycle**. | |
| **Strategic Value** | Monarchy's doubling of the leader's trait is highly favoured, and Autocracy's benefits are sometimes characterized as "tiny bonuses that are dwarfed by pretty much everything else". However, it is part of the path (Autocracy -> Communism) that can be aimed for to achieve **better time crystal results** in advanced, highly specialized runs. | |
| **Next Tier Policy/**| Leads to a choice between [Socialism]( {{< relref "Policy/Socialism.md" >}}) (which has no effect) and the next tier of Policy/ (Liberalism, Communism, or Fascism). | |

### Strategic Recommendation

For most players and early runs, [Monarchy]( {{< relref "Policy/Monarchy.md" >}}) is strongly recommended.

*   Monarchy provides a highly valuable and flexible tool by **doubling the leader's trait**. You can easily reassign a highly skilled leader (with doubled traits) to different roles to maximize whichever resource you are currently grinding, making it an *amazing* choice for efficiency.
*   While Autocracy can be useful for late-game strategies where the focus is on industrial output optimization and time crystal acquisition (leading to Communism), its direct bonuses are generally considered minor compared to Monarchy.

This choice is analogous to deciding whether to hire a general manager (Monarchy) who improves the overall culture and skill effectiveness across multiple departments, or a highly focused production specialist (Autocracy) who only doubles output in one area at a time; the general manager often provides more adaptable long-term benefits to a growing civilization.
