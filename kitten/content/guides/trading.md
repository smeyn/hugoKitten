The decision of **when is a good time to trade** in *Kittens Game* depends heavily on your current stage of progression, what specific resource you need, and which civilization you are trading with.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of trading timelines and strategic considerations:

### Early Game Trading (After Year 20)

You can begin trading early, as the **Trade tab unlocks after 20 years of gameplay** when a Lizard arrives, offering to trade Wood for Minerals. This can be decreased to **Year 5** if you have more than 0 Karma, and even to **Year 1** with the [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "Policy/Diplomacy.md" >}}) Metaphysics upgrade.

Trading is immediately useful for:

*   **Acquiring needed starting resources:** For example, Lizards sell Wood for Minerals.
*   **Hunting for Blueprints:** Any successful trade has a **10% chance of including one Blueprint** as an extra resource. This is fixed and cannot be increased by other trade bonuses. Because Blueprints have an incredibly steep production cost, players are advised to **keep Trading** until they "luck out and get a Blueprints for free".
*   **Acquiring Spice:** Spice (a luxury resource) has a **35% chance** of being included in a successful trade.

You must first create [Gold]( {{< relref "resource/Gold.md" >}}) before you can trade with anyone, which is accomplished by developing the [Gold Ore]( {{< relref "upgrade/Gold_Ore.md" >}}) upgrade in the Workshop.

### Mid-to-Late Game Trading (Titanium and Blueprint Acquisition)

Trading becomes central during the mid-game, particularly in the **Titanium era** (after researching Astronomy and Navigation).

*   **Trading for Titanium and Iron (Zebras):**
    *   Once you learn Navigation and build [Trade Ships]( {{< relref "craft/Trade_Ship.md" >}}) (which require Starcharts), you can **Send Explorers** to discover additional civilizations, including the hostile [Zebras]( {{< relref "trade/zebras.md" >}}).
    *   Zebras trade Slabs for **Titanium and Iron**.
    *   The focus becomes **trading with Zebras non-stop** to acquire Titanium and Iron.
    *   This is especially important in the **Concrete era**, where Blueprint requirements for sciences start becoming a bottleneck. Trading allows you to **stockpile blueprints** while also acquiring titanium and steel.

*   **Trading for Minerals/Automation (Nagas and Griffins):**
    *   [Nagas]( {{< relref "trade/Nagas.md" >}}) are discovered once you achieve **1500 Culture Cap**. They sell **Minerals** for Ivory. This trade can be used in a loop: trading Ivory for Minerals, then putting Minerals back into Smelters to produce Gold, which is needed for trade costs and other buildings.
    *   The sources also suggest a trading loop involving **Sharks and Griffins** to collect Wood, Steel, Gears, and Blueprints for [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}).

### Seasonal Considerations (Optimizing Trade Timing)

Trade rates are affected by seasons, making it optimal to trade certain resources during specific times of the year:

| Race/Resource | Season for Optimal Trade | Modifier | Strategic Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lizards (Wood)** | **Summer** | +35% (Also good in Autumn: +15%, and Winter: +5%) | Wood is generally useful for construction. |
| **Sharks (Catnip)** | **Winter** | +45% (Also good in Spring: +20%, and Autumn: +15%) | Good for supplementing food supply, especially during harsh winters. |
| **Griffins (Iron)** | **Autumn** | +35% | Useful for supporting Smelters and Steel production. |
| **Nagas (Minerals)** | **Spring** | +25% | Useful for early building materials and supporting Smelters. The guide suggests trading with Nagas **only in Spring**. |
| **Zebras (Iron)** | **Summer** | +15% | Zebras generally buy Slabs, making them an import source for Iron and Titanium. |
| **Zebras (Plate)** | **Winter** | +25% (Also good in Spring/Autumn: +5%) | Plate is important for advanced storage (Harbours). |
| **Spiders (Coal)** | **Autumn** | +15% | Useful for powering industrial buildings. |

### End-Game Trading (Blueprints and Final Push)

In the end-game, trading remains the fastest way to acquire large amounts of [Blueprints]( {{< relref "resource/Blueprint.md" >}}) and facilitates rapid resets:

*   **Fastest Reset Method:** Trading becomes the **fastest reset possible** once you have a massive Catpower stockpile. You can trade, acquire necessary Blueprints (which are needed for Chronospheres), and reset rapidly.
*   **Leviathans (Relics and Time Crystals):** Once you acquire a [Black Pyramid]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Black_Pyramid.md" >}}), [Leviathans]( {{< relref "trade/Leviathans.md" >}}) appear and trade [Unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}}) for advanced resources like **Time Crystals, Relics, and Sorrow**. This trade has no seasonal adjustment.

In summary, you should start trading as soon as you meet the prerequisites (Gold and [Currency]( {{< relref "techs/Currency.md" >}}) technology), prioritize it in the **Titanium era** to secure Blueprints and Titanium from Zebras, and time your trades with Nagas, Griffins, and Sharks according to the [seasons]( {{< relref "guides/seasons.md" >}}) to maximize resource returns.

Trading often acts as a supply chain bridge, like using a freight train to move large quantities of bulk goods needed for heavy industry, rather than trying to hand-carry every component.
