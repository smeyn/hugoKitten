[Rationing]( {{< relref "Policy/Rationing.md" >}}) and [Frugality]( {{< relref "Policy/Frugality.md" >}}) are mutually exclusive Philosophical Policy/ in *Kittens Game*, both requiring the precursor policy [Stoicism]( {{< relref "Policy/Stoicism.md" >}}) and costing 3,500 Culture. The choice between them depends on whether you prioritise managing food consumption penalties or boosting automated rare resource production.

Here is a breakdown of their effects:

| Policy | Prerequisite | Cost | Key Effects |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Rationing]( {{< relref "Policy/Rationing.md" >}}) | Stoicism | 3500 Culture | **Reduces Catnip Consumption:** Decreases the catnip consumption increase caused by high happiness by $-10\%$. **Boosts Hunting:** Provides a permanent $+0.1$ Hunting bonus. |
| [Frugality]( {{< relref "Policy/Frugality.md" >}}) | Stoicism | 3500 Culture | **Boosts Mints:** Increases the resource output of Mints by $+10\%$. |

### Strategic Context

The decision between Rationing and Frugality often arises when a player is attempting to manage late-game resource consumption, particularly luxury resources (Furs, Ivory, Spice) and Catnip demand, which is heavily increased by high Happiness levels (e.g., $420\%$ happiness increases catnip consumption by $320\%$).

*   [Rationing]( {{< relref "Policy/Rationing.md" >}}) is useful if you are struggling with keeping up with food demands, as it mitigates the negative effect that increased Happiness has on catnip consumption. The bonus to Hunting also provides a slight general boost to acquiring Furs, Ivory, and Unicorns.
*   [Frugality]( {{< relref "Policy/Frugality.md" >}}) is specifically designed to make the automated production of resources from [Mints]( {{< relref "buildings/Mint.md" >}}) more effective, resulting in $10\%$ more output from them. Mints are important for generating Furs and Ivory later in the game.

General strategic advice suggests that by the time you reach this choice, if you are still running out of luxury resources despite already having [Stoicism]( {{< relref "Policy/Stoicism.md" >}}) (which halves luxury resource consumption) and many [Tradeposts]( {{< relref "buildings/Tradepost.md" >}}) (which slow consumption), either Rationing or Frugality might help, but they are often viewed as providing relatively minor gains compared to major production multipliers available elsewhere.
