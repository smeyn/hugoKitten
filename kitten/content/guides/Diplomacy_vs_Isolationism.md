+++

Both [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "Policy/Diplomacy.md" >}}) and [Isolationism]( {{< relref "Policy/Isolationism.md" >}}) are **Foreign Policy/** available in *Kittens Game*, costing **1,600 Culture** each and requiring the [Currency]( {{< relref "techs/Currency.md" >}}) technology as a prerequisite. They represent a choice in your society's foreign relations path, with impacts on trade costs and future policy options.

Here is a comparison of the two Policy/:

### Diplomacy

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | Culture 1600 |
| **Prerequisite** | Currency |
| **Effect** | **Each trade costs 5 less catpower**. |
| **Policy Path** | Leads to [Cultural Exchange]( {{< relref "Policy/Cultural_Exchange.md" >}}) or [Knowledge Sharing]( {{< relref "Policy/Knowledge_Sharing.md" >}}) (after researching Astronomy). |
| **Strategic Value** | This policy is generally preferred because it unlocks the path to [Cultural Exchange]( {{< relref "Policy/Cultural_Exchange.md" >}}), which provides a bonus to Culture, a resource that is often slow to acquire. |
| **Related Meta**| The [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "Policy/Diplomacy.md" >}}) Metaphysics upgrade improves the trade process by reducing the unlock year for races from Year 5 to Year 1, and increases standing ratio. |

### Isolationism

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | Culture 1600 |
| **Prerequisite** | Currency |
| **Effect** | **Each trade costs 1 less gold**. |
| **Policy Path** | Leads to [Big Stick Policy]( {{< relref "Policy/Big_Stick_Policy.md" >}}) or [City On A Hill]( {{< relref "Policy/City_On_A_Hill.md" >}}) (after researching Astronomy). |
| **Strategic Value** | While the gold discount might "feel good," the subsequent Policy/ in this path are generally considered less beneficial ("aren't any good"). |

### Strategic Recommendation

For most runs, [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "Policy/Diplomacy.md" >}}) is the recommended choice.

The primary advantage of Diplomacy is accessing the later Policy/:

*   [Cultural Exchange]( {{< relref "Policy/Cultural_Exchange.md" >}}) (+5% culture income) is highly valuable because Culture is a resource that accumulates slowly.
*   [Knowledge Sharing]( {{< relref "Policy/Knowledge_Sharing.md" >}}) (+5% science income) is the alternative, although Science is generally easier to obtain than Culture, making Cultural Exchange the common preference.

Conversely, choosing [Isolationism]( {{< relref "Policy/Isolationism.md" >}}) grants a Gold discount on trades, but the resulting Policy/ ([Big Stick Policy]( {{< relref "Policy/Big_Stick_Policy.md" >}}) and [City On A Hill]( {{< relref "Policy/City_On_A_Hill.md" >}})) are considered weaker options. Big Stick Policy makes Embassies 15% cheaper, while City On A Hill increases Culture cap by 5%.

In summary, choosing [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "Policy/Diplomacy.md" >}}) prioritises long-term resource boosts (Culture) via future Policy/, whereas [Isolationism]( {{< relref "Policy/Isolationism.md" >}}) provides a minor, immediate reduction in gold expenditure during trade.
