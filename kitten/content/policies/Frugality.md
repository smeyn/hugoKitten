The term "Frugality" refers to a specific policy available to your kittens' civilization within *Kittens Game*.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the Frugality policy:

### Overview and Prerequisite

*   **Cost:** Frugality costs 3500 Culture.
*   **Prerequisite:** The Frugality policy is unlocked only after first choosing [Stoicism]( {{< relref "policies/Stoicism.md" >}}). Stoicism, in turn, is a policy in the Philosophy category, which requires researching [Philosophy]( {{< relref "science/Philosophy.md" >}}).
*   **Context:** Frugality is an option that appears as part of the philosophical policy tree, contrasted with [Rationing]( {{< relref "policies/Rationing.md" >}}).

### Effects of Frugality

The Frugality policy focuses on optimizing output from economic buildings by reducing perceived corruption.

*   **Effect:** Stoic philosophers placed in charge of the mints make them more effective by reducing corruption. Consequently, **Mints produce 10% more resources**.

### Strategic Considerations

Frugality is typically considered as an alternative choice when dealing with luxury resource consumption and happiness management:

*   **Policy Path:** Frugality follows the Stoicism path, which is centered on enduring hardship and reducing luxury consumption.
*   **Alternative:** Frugality is paired against the [Rationing]( {{< relref "policies/Rationing.md" >}}) policy. Rationing, also following Stoicism, makes hunting more effective (+0.1 Hunting bonus) and reduces the catnip consumption increase per happiness by 10%.
*   **Expert Opinion:** Strategic advice suggests that Frugality might be chosen if consumption mitigation (provided by Stoicism or Rationing) is still insufficient, or if the increased output from Mints is desired, though one source notes, "...maybe the increased output from mints with Frugality... but probably not...".

In essence, Frugality is a philosophical policy intended to boost the output of specialized financial/luxury-resource structures (Mints) after prioritizing austerity (Stoicism).
