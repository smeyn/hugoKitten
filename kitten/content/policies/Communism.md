+++

The policy [Communism]( {{< relref "policies/Communism.md" >}}) is an advanced Government policy choice in *Kittens Game*, aimed at accelerating industrial output at the expense of environmental stability.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the policy:

### Policy Mechanics

*   **Cost:** Communism costs **15,000 Culture**.
*   **Description:** It is described as supporting "**Industrialization at all costs**".
*   **Prerequisites:** You must have researched the initial government policy path and built a [Factory]( {{< relref "buildings/Factory.md" >}}). Communism is available if you previously chose [Autocracy]( {{< relref "policies/Autocracy.md" >}}) or [Republic]( {{< relref "policies/Republic.md" >}}).
*   **Locks:** Choosing Communism prevents you from selecting Liberalism or Fascism.

### Effects and Drawbacks

Communism provides powerful industrial bonuses but carries a severe risk related to food production:

| Type | Effect | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Production Boost** | **+25% iron, coal, and titanium production** | This provides a significant boost to key industrial and late-game resources. |
| **Cost Reduction** | **Factories are 30% cheaper** | This makes scaling industrial capacity less expensive. |
| **Major Drawback** | **Catnip field production becomes -100% in cold winters** | This severely impacts food security during the harshest season. |

### Strategic Context

In the mid-to-late game, the choice between Liberalism, Fascism, and Communism depends on the player's immediate needs:

*   **Industry Boost:** If **zebra hostility has been negated** already, players are advised to **pick Communism to boost your industry**.
*   **Time Crystal Production:** In extreme long-term runs, such as the Iron Will 40K challenge, experts suggest aiming for the policy path **Tradition $\to$ Autocracy $\to$ Communism**, specifically noting that **Communism will give you better time crystal results** compared to Liberalism.
*   **Alternatives:** If the player is struggling with zebra hostility (which inhibits acquiring necessary titanium), [Liberalism]( {{< relref "policies/Liberalism.md" >}}) might be preferred. In a first run, [Fascism]( {{< relref "policies/Fascism.md" >}}) might be chosen temporarily, as it makes log cabins 50% cheaper and helps the player reach the target of 130+ kittens before the first reset.
