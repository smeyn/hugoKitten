The term [Environmentalism]( {{< relref "policies/Environmentalism.md" >}}) refers to a specific policy available to your kitten society, categorized under the **Environment** section of the policy system. This policy category is unlocked after researching [Engineering]( {{< relref "techs/Engineering.md" >}}).

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Environmentalism policy:

### Effects and Cost

*   **Cost:** Environmentalism costs **2000 Culture**.
*   **Description:** The policy is focused on preserving the natural beauty of your village.
*   **Effects:** Environmentalism provides a slight boost to kitten happiness and a small reduction in pollution:
    *   **+3% happiness**.
    *   **-5% pollution**.

### Policy Context and Strategy

Environmentalism is one of three initial options within the Environment policy group, and selecting it dictates the future path of subsequent environmental policies.

1.  **Policy Group:** Environmentalism is available alongside [Strip Mining]( {{< relref "policies/Strip_Mining.md" >}}) (which increases mineral production and pollution) and [Clear Cutting]( {{< relref "policies/Clear_Cutting.md" >}}) (which increases wood production and pollution).
2.  **Prerequisite:** [Engineering]( {{< relref "techs/Engineering.md" >}}).
3.  **Subsequent Policies:** Choosing Environmentalism unlocks the [Conservation]( {{< relref "policies/Conservation.md" >}}) and [Open Woodlands]( {{< relref "policies/Open_Woodlands.md" >}}) policies later in the game.

### Strategic Evaluation

Guidance from experts in the sources suggests that Environmentalism is generally the least favourable choice among the initial environmental policies:

*   **Weak Effect:** Environmentalism is considered "pretty weak and doesn't do much for you". The reduction in pollution is generally slight.
*   **Recommended Alternative:** [Clear Cutting]( {{< relref "policies/Clear_Cutting.md" >}}) is usually recommended instead, as the substantial boost to wood production is crucial for constructing observatories, harbours, and trade ships later in the game.
*   **Pollution Mitigation:** While pollution is a concern (negatively affecting catnip production, happiness, and kitten arrival speed), the effect of Environmentalism is often insufficient to fully mitigate it. Most players must accept that some pollution *will* happen.

Later policies that stem from Environmentalism, like [Conservation]( {{< relref "policies/Conservation.md" >}}), can increase happiness further (+5% happiness, -5% pollution), while [Open Woodlands]( {{< relref "policies/Open_Woodlands.md" >}}) offers production bonuses (+12.5% wood and mineral production, +5% pollution).

**In summary, Environmentalism is an early-game policy focused on minor happiness and pollution control, but its immediate resource gain is generally inferior to the resource-boosting options like Clear Cutting or Strip Mining.**
