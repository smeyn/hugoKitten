The policy [Clear Cutting]( {{< relref "policies/Clear_Cutting.md" >}}) is a foundational option in the **Environment** policy group, unlocked once your civilization has researched [Engineering]( {{< relref "techs/Engineering.md" >}}).

This policy is generally recommended by experienced players due to the large production boost it provides to a critical early/mid-game resource: wood.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Clear Cutting policy:

### Policy Details and Effects

Clear Cutting is described as an effort to **totally destroy the forest** to improve wood production.

*   **Cost:** The policy requires **2000 Science**.
*   **Primary Effect (Standard Game):** It grants a substantial **+30% wood production** bonus.
*   **Drawbacks:** This focus on aggressive resource extraction comes at the cost of environmental health and happiness:
    *   **-2% happiness**.
    *   **+5% pollution**.
*   **Iron Will Effect:** In the challenging Iron Will mode, Clear Cutting provides a **+10% bonus to catnip refinement**, which is similar to the effect of one un-upgraded Lumber Mill.

### Strategic Importance

Clear Cutting is considered a crucial early policy because wood is necessary for major construction goals in the mid-game, validating the policy's drawbacks.

*   **Mid-Game Progression:** The increased wood production is **"a huge help"** for gathering the resources necessary to build subsequent critical structures like **observatories, harbours, and ships**.
*   **Comparison to Alternatives:** Experts advise choosing Clear Cutting over its initial rivals in the Environment tree:
    *   [Strip Mining:]( {{< relref "policies/Strip_Mining.md" >}}) This policy boosts mineral production, but minerals are generally easier to acquire than wood during this phase.
    *   [Environmentalism:]( {{< relref "policies/Environmentalism.md" >}}) This policy is considered "pretty weak" and doesn't offer much practical benefit, especially compared to the production boost from Clear Cutting.
*   **Mitigation and Upgrades:** The negative happiness penalty associated with Clear Cutting (and Strip Mining) can be removed later by adopting the [Sustainability]( {{< relref "policies/Sustainability.md" >}}) policy. Additionally, choosing Clear Cutting keeps the path open for the later policy [Full Industrialization]( {{< relref "policies/Full_Industrialization.md" >}}), which boosts factory effectiveness, crucial for deep mid-game scaling.

**In essence, Clear Cutting is a policy choice that prioritizes aggressive short-term resource growth (wood) over early happiness and pollution control, leveraging that wood to quickly build the structures needed for navigating the next phase of the game.**
