Conservation is a mid-to-late-game policy available in *Kittens Game*, focusing on environmental preservation.

Here is a breakdown of the Conservation policy, its effects, prerequisites, and strategic evaluation:

### Policy Details and Effects

*   **Cost:** Conservation costs **10,000 Culture**.
*   **Description:** This policy represents actively protecting the environment, building upon earlier environmental efforts.
*   **Effects:** Conservation provides bonuses primarily related to happiness and pollution control:
    *   **+5% happiness**.
    *   **-5% pollution**.

### Prerequisites

Conservation is located deep within the Environment policy tree and requires specific research and an initial policy choice:

1.  **Technology:** It requires [Ecology]( {{< relref "techs/Ecology.md" >}}) to be researched.
2.  **Parent Policy:** It is unlocked by choosing the [Environmentalism]( {{< relref "policies/Environmentalism.md" >}}) policy earlier in the game.
3.  **Locks:** Conservation locks the subsequent choice of [Open Woodlands]( {{< relref "policies/Open_Woodlands.md" >}}).

### Strategic Context and Evaluation

Policies in the Environment category often present a choice between immediate resource maximization (like wood or minerals) and environmental moderation (like pollution control).

*   **Weak Utility:** Conservation is generally considered "pretty weak and doesn't do much for you". While it offers increased happiness and reduced pollution, it lacks the raw resource boost offered by its alternatives.
*   **Alternative Choice:** Conservation is frequently compared unfavorably to [Open Woodlands]( {{< relref "policies/Open_Woodlands.md" >}}), which follows the same Environmentalism path. Open Woodlands provides a substantial production boost of **+12.5% wood and mineral production** (but adds +5% pollution). Expert advice usually recommends [Open Woodlands]( {{< relref "policies/Open_Woodlands.md" >}}) because production bonuses are crucial for progression.
*   **Pollution Management:** The small reduction in pollution from Conservation may not be sufficient to negate the pollution generated by industrial buildings like Mines, Smelters, and Factories, which negatively impacts catnip production, happiness, and kitten arrival speed. Players are generally advised that some pollution *will* occur regardless of the environmental policies chosen.
