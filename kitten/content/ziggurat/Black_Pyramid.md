The [Black Pyramid]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Black_Pyramid.md" >}}) is a significant religious megastructure in the late-game Unicorn/Time Crystal progression path, serving as a gateway to interacting with the powerful Leviathan race.

### 1. Requirements and Acquisition

The Black Pyramid is a high-cost structure unlocked via the **Megalomania** metaphysics upgrade.

*   **Cost:** Building one Black Pyramid requires **5 Sorrow** (also known as Black Liquid Sorrow or BLS), **2500 Megalith**, **150,000 Spice**, and **5000 Unobtainium**.
*   **Unlock Path:** To obtain the necessary resource, the player must first build a [Ziggurat]( {{< relref "buildings/Ziggurat.md" >}}), sacrifice 2500 Unicorns for Unicorn Tears, and then refine 10,000 Tears into 1 Sorrow. After collecting 5 Sorrow, the Black Pyramid can be constructed.

### 2. Effects and Strategic Importance

The construction of the Black Pyramid dramatically shifts the endgame progression by introducing the Leviathans and enhancing subsequent late-game resource mechanisms.

*   **Leviathan Trading:** The primary effect of building a Black Pyramid is that it **unlocks trade with the Leviathans**. Leviathans are crucial because they allow the player to trade **5000 Unobtainium** for scarce resources like [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}) (with a 98% chance), [Relics]( {{< relref "resource/relic.md" >}}) (with a 5% chance), and **Black Liquid Sorrow** (with a 15% chance).
*   **Leviathan Appearance:** More Black Pyramids mean the Leviathans show up more often.
*   **Black Nexus and Relic Production:** The Black Pyramid provides a multiplicative bonus to relic generation mechanisms.
    *   The [Black Nexus]( {{< relref "transcendence/Black_Nexus.md" >}}) upgrade, unlocked at Transcendence Tier 3, produces relics based on the formula: $1 + (\text{Black Nexus} \times \text{Black Pyramid})$ relics.
    *   Similarly, **Space Beacons** upgraded with [Relic Station]( {{< relref "upgrade/Relic_Station.md" >}}) produce relics, and this rate is boosted by $+10\%$ relic production per Black Pyramid per Black Nexus.
    *   The **Pact of Cleansing** and **Pact of Destruction** benefits, which respectively increase global resource limits and global production, scale with the number of Black Pyramids.
*   **Challenge Reward:** Completing the **Black Sky Challenge** provides the **Base Reward** of having Elders arrive early, which acts as a free, invisible Black Pyramid. This invisible structure functions just like a real Black Pyramid, improving the effects of the Black Nexus and other related structures.

The Black Pyramid is described as "A dark relic of unspeakable horrors". Its acquisition is a key turning point, marking the start of the **Unicorn/Time crystal Era** and providing access to Time Crystals, which are essential for unlocking Chronospheres and performing prestige resets.
