The **Sky Palace** is a specialized religious building that is part of the advanced Unicorn progression line.

Here is a detailed breakdown of its function, effects, and prerequisites:

### Function and Effects

The Sky Palace provides multiple bonuses related to the generation of rare luxury resources and general storage [1]:

*   **Unicorn Generation:** It **improves unicorn generation by 50%** [1].
*   **Gold Storage:** It **improves gold storage by +1%** [1].
*   **Alicorn Production:** It produces **$0.00002$ alicorns per tick** (or $0.0001$ per second, $0.08$ per year) [1].
*   **Alicorn Event:** It enables a random event that grants one alicorn [1].
    *   Each Sky Palace built increases the frequency of this event by **$0.01\%$ per game-day** (or $1\%$ per day per 100 palaces) [1].
*   **Ivory Meteors:** It **increases ivory gained from Ivory Meteors by $5\%$** [1].

### Acquisition and Prerequisites

The Sky Palace is unlocked and constructed in the Religion tab, following a specific upgrade path [1]:

*   **Prerequisites:** You must **complete 1 Ivory Citadel** to unlock the Sky Palace [1].
    *   The Ivory Citadel requires completing an Ivory Tower, which in turn requires completing a Unicorn Tomb [1, 2].
*   **Cost:** The Sky Palace requires the following resources to build [1]:
    *   **500 Tears**
    *   **125,000 Ivory**
    *   **5 Megalith**
*   **Ratio:** It has a price ratio of $1.15$ [1].

### Place in the Unicorn Progression

The Sky Palace is an intermediate step in maximizing unicorn-related production, leading to even more powerful buildings [1]:

*   Once you complete 1 Sky Palace, you unlock the **Unicorn Utopia**, which further improves unicorn generation by $250\%$ and increases the Time Crystal Refine ratio by $5\%$ [3].
*   The Sky Palace, along with other advanced Unicorn buildings like the Ivory Tower and Ivory Citadel, helps generate ivory and alicorns, which are critical for late-game progression [1, 2]. Unicorns, alicorns, and tears are all considered luxury resources, contributing a bonus to happiness [4].
