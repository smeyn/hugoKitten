Marker
The Marker is a much later, extremely expensive religious structure that marks the transition into the Necrocorn/Leviathan resource loop.

Specification
Citation
Prerequisite Metaphysics
Unlocked by the Megalomania Metaphysics upgrade (Cost: 10 Paragon).
Building Cost
5,000 Tears, 750 Megalith, 50,000 Spice, and 2,500 Unobtainium.
Primary Function
Markers start a ticking corruption countdown that slowly changes alicorns into necrocorns.
Strategic Function
Each Marker increases the elder energy cap by 5. Necrocorns generated via Markers are used to feed the Leviathans, which permanently prolongs their duration and improves the Time Crystal trading ratio. Markers are acquired as part of the strategic objective to maximise Relic and Time Crystal income.
The Ziggurat represents the initial investment phase (Phase 2/3) in the unicorn resource line, while the Marker is a critical structure in the hyper-advanced phase (Phase 3/4) required to stabilize the crucial Time Crystal engine and interact with the Leviathans for maximum efficiency.
