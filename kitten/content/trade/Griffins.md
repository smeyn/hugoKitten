The [Griffins]( {{< relref "trade/Griffins.md" >}}) are a crucial trading partner in *Kittens Game* known for providing foundational industrial resources, primarily Iron, despite their hostile disposition.

Here is a comprehensive overview of the Griffins:

### Attitude and Trade Details

*   [Attitude:]( {{< relref "trade/Attitude.md" >}}) Griffins are a **Hostile** civilization, starting with an attitude of **-15%**. Hostile civilizations carry a risk of giving you no resources at all during a trade.
*    Griffins **buy Wood** (minimum 500 units).
*   **Primary Export:** They sell **Iron** (minimum 250 units, 100% chance).
*   **Secondary Exports (Unlocked via Embassies):**
    *   [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) (25 units, 25% chance) at Embassy Level 5. The sources note that with enough embassies, Griffins are a great way to collect a lot of [steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}).
    *   [Gear]( {{< relref "craft/Gear.md" >}}) (5 units, 10% chance) at Embassy Level 10.
*   **Seasonal Optimization:** Trading for **Iron** is optimally performed during **Autumn**, which provides a **+35% Amount Modifier**. Conversely, the trade is worst during Spring (-25%) and Winter (-20%).

### Strategic Role

Griffins play a key role in overcoming bottlenecks in Iron production, particularly during the Infrastructure and Trade Arbitrage phase of the game:

1.  **Iron Bottleneck Resolution:** Trading Wood to Griffins in exchange for Iron is a core mechanism used to bypass the slower rates of production-based smelting. This trade converts low-value, high-volume resources (Wood) into high-value capital (Iron).
2.   Griffins are central to a strategic trade loop involving Sharks. This loop starts in **Autumn** by trading **Wood to the Griffins to gather Iron**. This acquired Iron can then be traded to Sharks for Catnip in **Winter**, which can be refined into Wood to repeat the cycle. This loop is effective for collecting Wood, [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}), [Gears]( {{< relref "craft/Gear.md" >}}), and [Blueprints]( {{< relref "resource/Blueprint.md" >}}) for Steamworks.
3.   The steel acquired from Griffins is required for crafting [Gears]( {{< relref "craft/Gear.md" >}}).

### Related Policy/

Once you reach Embassy Level 20 and research the Diplomacy metaphysics upgrade, you can choose one of three specialized  Policy/ (all costing 16,000 Culture):

*    Improves the Calciner's steel production bonus by **+15%**.
*    Boosts hunting effectiveness by **+50%**.
*    Improves the Steamwork's Magneto boost bonus by **+0.5%**.

The trade relationship with Griffins functions much like engaging an overseas vendor for factory supplies; although they are hostile and require diplomatic investment (Trade Posts, policy choice) to ensure reliable delivery, they provide essential structural materials (Iron and Steel) that are otherwise too slow to produce locally.
