The [Sharks]( {{< relref "trade/Sharks.md" >}}) are a pivotal trading civilization in *Kittens Game*, primarily valued for their large supply of Catnip in exchange for Iron, often playing a role in crucial resource trade loops.

### Trading Profile and Unlocking

*   [Attitude:]( {{< relref "trade/Attitude.md" >}}) Sharks are a **Neutral (0%)** civilization.
*   **Discovery:** They can be discovered after **20 years of game play**, though this is reduced to **Year 5** if you have Karma, or **Year 1** with the [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "policies/Diplomacy.md" >}}) Metaphysics upgrade.
*   **Trade Currency:** Like all civilizations, trading requires you to first develop the [Gold Ore]( {{< relref "upgrade/Gold_Ore.md" >}}) upgrade in the Workshop.

### Primary Trade and Seasonal Optimization

Sharks specialize in the exchange of Iron for Catnip:

*   **Sharks Buy:** **Iron** (minimum 100 units).
*   **Sharks Sell:** **Catnip** (minimum 35,000 units).
    *   This catnip can be refined into **Wood** for construction purposes.
*    Trading for Catnip is optimally performed during **Winter**, which provides a **+45% Amount Modifier**. They also offer a good bonus in Spring (+20%) and Autumn (+15%), but the trade is worst in Summer (-5%).

### Secondary and Rare Resources

As you build Embassies with the Sharks, they unlock more sophisticated trade items:

*   **Crafted Paper:** At Embassy Level 5, they may sell [Parchment]( {{< relref "craft/Parchment.md" >}}) (5 units, 25% chance); at Level 10, [Manuscript]( {{< relref "craft/Manuscript.md" >}}) (3 units, 15% chance); and at Level 15, [Compendium]( {{< relref "compendium.md" >}}) (1 unit, 10% chance).
*    Any successful trade with Sharks has a fixed **10% chance of yielding one Blueprint** and a **35% chance of yielding Spice** as an extra resource.

### Strategic Role (The Trade Loop)

Sharks are essential in a powerful industrial trade loop, often paired with the hostile Griffins:

1.  The cycle begins in **Autumn** by trading **Wood to Griffins to gather Iron**.
2.  In **Winter**, this acquired **Iron is traded to Sharks for Catnip**.
3.  The Catnip is then refined into **Wood** (costing 50 catnip per wood after the [Catnip Enrichment]( {{< relref "upgrade/Catnip_Enrichment.md" >}}) upgrade) to prepare for the next Autumn trade with Griffins.

This trading loop is a "great way to start collecting wood, [steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}), [gears]( {{< relref "craft/Gear.md" >}}), and [blueprints]( {{< relref "resource/Blueprint.md" >}}) for [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}})".

### Advanced Policies

If you reach Embassy Level 20 and have the [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "policies/Diplomacy.md" >}}) Metaphysics upgrade, you unlock specific Shark Relations policies that further enhance resource production and trade efficiency:

*    Increases Parchment and Manuscript trade chance, but raises the Iron cost per trade by 50%.
*    Boosts trade ratio, starting at +3% and scaling multiplicatively up to +30% based on the total trades completed.
*    Provides a  (catnip refinement).

### Role in Challenges

In the difficult **Iron Will** challenge, especially when combined with the **Black Sky Challenge**, the Sharks' role shifts dramatically:

*   **Trade Change:** Sharks trade **iron for science**.
*   **Trade Cost:** The trade initially requires only iron, then shifts to require **catpower** after the first Zebra joins, and finally requires [gold]( {{< relref "resource/Gold.md" >}}) once Currency and Gold Ore are researched.
*   **Seasonal Inversion:** The seasonal adjustments are **inverted** while Sharks are science traders.
