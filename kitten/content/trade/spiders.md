The [Spiders]( {{< relref "trade/spiders.md" >}}) are a **Friendly** civilization (+15% attitude) in *Kittens Game* who primarily function as a trading partner for industrial resources, particularly [Coal]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}).

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Spiders:

### Unlocking and Attitude

*   [Attitude:]( {{< relref "trade/Attitude.md" >}}) Spiders are designated as a **Friendly** civilization, meaning they have an initial positive attitude of **+15%**. Friendly civilizations have a chance of giving you **15–25% extra resources** during a trade.
*   **Prerequisites:** Discovering the Spiders requires reaching significant progress in space and technology, specifically needing **100 Trade Ships** and a maximum [Science]( {{< relref "resource/science.md" >}}) limit of **125,000**.
    *   Due to the high maximum science requirement, Spiders are considered "waayyyy off" for players in the early to mid-game stages.

### Trade Details

Spiders primarily exchange the crafted resource [Scaffold]( {{< relref "craft/Scaffold.md" >}}) for [Coal]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}):

| Action | Resource | Minimum Amount | Cost/Gain | Seasonal Optimization |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Buy** | Scaffold | 50 | Cost | N/A |
| **Sell** | [Coal]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}) | 350 | Gain | **Autumn (+15%)** |
| **Sell** | Oil | 100 | Gain (25% chance, Embassy Level 5) | N/A |

*   [Coal:]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}) They sell a minimum amount of **350 Coal** per trade, with a 100% chance of delivery and a 15% range bonus.
*   **Oil:** Once you reach Embassy Level 5, Spiders also sell **100 Oil** per trade, though there is only a **25% chance** of receiving this resource.
*   **Seasonal Bonus:** Trading for Coal is most efficient during **Autumn**, which provides an additional **+15% Amount Modifier**.

### Strategic Context

While Spiders provide a vital source of [Coal]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}), early-game advice suggests that acquiring coal from them via scaffold-trading is generally **not realistic** for players focused on lower-tier progression.

For players who are actively engaging with the Spiders trade route, the coal they provide can be used to fuel industrial buildings like the Steamworks or for crafting advanced materials like [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) (which requires 100 Coal and 100 Iron).
