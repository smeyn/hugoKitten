The [Zebras]( {{< relref "trade/zebras.md" >}}) are a crucial civilization in *Kittens Game*, primarily known as  who provide essential industrial resources during the mid-game, particularly in the Titanium era.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the Zebras, their role in trade, and their unique function in the Iron Will challenge:

### Trading and Strategic Importance

Zebras are primarily sought after for their critical resource exports:

*   **Acquisition and Attitude:** Zebras are a **Hostile** civilization with an initial attitude of **-30%**. They are unlocked once you have **1 Trade Ship**. Since they are hostile, they have a chance of giving you no resources at all during a trade.
*   **Trade Mitigation:** The penalty from Zebra hostility can be negated by building a sufficient number of [Tradeposts]( {{< relref "buildings/Tradepost.md" >}}) (85 posts, or 58 with the Diplomacy Metaphysics upgrade).
*   **Resources Traded:** Zebras **buy Slab** (50 minimum). In return, they sell three critical resources:
    *   **Iron** (300 minimum amount).
    *   [Plate]( {{< relref "resource/plate.md" >}}) (2 minimum, with a 65% chance).
    *   [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) (amount is calculated based on the number of Trade Ships you possess: `(0.03 * Trade Ships) + 1.5`).
    *   They also offer [Alloy]( {{< relref "craft/Alloy.md" >}}) (0.25 minimum, 5% chance) once you reach Embassy Level 5.
*   **Titanium Trade Mechanic:** Unlike most resources gained through trade, the amount of [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) received from the Zebras  (such as the bonus received from Tradeposts).
*   **Seasonal Optimization:** Trades are best conducted during **Summer** for Iron (+15% amount modifier) and **Winter** for Plate (+25% amount modifier).
*   **Strategic Goal:** In the Titanium era, the focus often becomes **trading with Zebras non stop** to acquire **Titanium and Iron**. This trade is crucial for unlocking titanium-heavy technologies and buildings.

### Policies and Upgrades

Zebras are associated with several policies and specialized upgrades:

*    After meeting the Zebras, you must choose between two foreign policies:
    *   **Zebra Relations: Appeasement** (5000 Culture): This policy is generally preferred because it improves relations (equivalent to 15 extra tradeposts) and provides a multiplicative boost to the titanium trade ratio (equivalent to 15 tradeposts). It is highly recommended because players are often **desperate for titanium**.
    *   **Zebra Relations: Bellicosity** (5000 Culture): This policy worsens relations with Zebras but slightly improves relations with other races.
*    There are several buildings associated with this race, including the [Zebra Outpost]( {{< relref "buildings/Zebra_Outpost.md" >}}), [Zebra Workshop]( {{< relref "buildings/Zebra_Workshop.md" >}}), and [Zebra Forge]( {{< relref "buildings/Zebra_Forge.md" >}}). Additionally, the workshop upgrade [Minerology Department]( {{< relref "zebraUpgrades/Minerology_department.md" >}}) is a Zebra upgrade for Academies.

### Role in Iron Will (IW) Mode

In the specialized **Iron Will** challenge (a mode played without kittens or housing), Zebras adopt a unique and critical function:

*   **Job Replacement:** In IW mode, [Zebras]( {{< relref "trade/zebras.md" >}}) are categorized as a **Special Resource** that acts as [hunters]( {{< relref "job/Hunter.md" >}}) to replace the absent kitten population, generating **Catpower**. Catpower is essential for hunting, which yields [Gold]( {{< relref "resource/Gold.md" >}}) (due to the Gold Ore upgrade effect in IW mode) and **Ivory**.
*   **Acquisition:** You gain one zebra after researching [Archery]( {{< relref "techs/Archery.md" >}}). Players often perform **short reset runs (6 to 10 runs)** solely to rush Archery and accumulate .
*   **Zebra Limit:** The maximum zebra limit can be increased by **1** every time you research [Archery]( {{< relref "techs/Archery.md" >}}) and reset (up to 10 or 11 initially). The limit also increases based on the amount of science spent in the previous run.
*    While a higher zebra count is desired to speed up hunting and catpower generation, diminishing returns on catpower production start to set in .
*   [Bloodstone:]( {{< relref "craft/Bloodstone.md" >}}) If you have at least  in IW mode, hunting gains a **0.05% chance of yielding Bloodstone**.
*   **IW Carryover:** The **Zebra counter** carries over when you reset the game. The **Zebra Diplomacy** and **Zebra Covenant** Metaphysics upgrades allow a portion of your Zebras (10% and 50% of cap, respectively) to remain if you choose to end Iron Will mode by building housing.

**Analogy:** Zebras act as an offshore supplier for heavy manufacturing materials. They are a hostile, high-risk trade partner, but they are the only reliable source for large quantities of [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}})—the resource needed to build your space program and advanced factories. In the unique constraints of Iron Will, however, they become a primary workforce, serving as essential substitute hunters to generate the gold and ivory required for civilization building.
