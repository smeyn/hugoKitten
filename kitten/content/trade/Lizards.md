The [Lizards]( {{< relref "trade/Lizards.md" >}}) are the **first trade partner** you encounter in *Kittens Game*, and they are crucial for unlocking the **Trade tab** and establishing early access to resources you may struggle to produce initially.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Lizards:

### Unlocking and Attitude

*   **Discovery:** A Lizard arrives at your Village after **20 years of game play**, offering to trade Wood for Minerals, which immediately unlocks the Trade tab.
*   **Prerequisite Reduction:** This initial unlock time of Year 20 can be reduced to **Year 5** if you have more than 0 Karma, and can be further reduced to **Year 1** with the **Diplomacy Metaphysics** upgrade.
*   [Attitude:]( {{< relref "trade/Attitude.md" >}}) Lizards are categorized as a **Friendly** civilization, starting with a high attitude bonus of **+25%**. As a Friendly civilization, they have a chance of giving you **15–25% extra resources** during a successful trade.
*   **Currency Requirement:** Before you can trade with the Lizards, you must first develop the [Gold Ore]( {{< relref "upgrade/Gold_Ore.md" >}}) upgrade in the Workshop, enabling you to create [Gold]( {{< relref "resource/Gold.md" >}}).

### Trade Details

The Lizards' primary trade early in the game involves wood and minerals, helping to balance your foundational resource production:

| Action | Resource | Minimum Amount | Cost/Gain | Strategic Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Buy** | Minerals | 1000 | Cost | Lizards buy Minerals. |
| **Sell** | Wood | 500 | Gain | Lizards sell Wood. |

**Secondary Resources Unlocked via Embassies:**
Building embassies with the Lizards allows access to advanced materials:
*   **Beam** (10 units, 15% chance) at Embassy Level 5.
*   [Scaffold]( {{< relref "craft/Scaffold.md" >}}) (1 unit, 10% chance) at Embassy Level 10.

**Seasonal Optimization:**
Lizard trades for Wood are subject to seasonal adjustments, making it most efficient to trade during **Summer**:

*   **Summer:** **+35% Amount Modifier** for Wood.
*   **Autumn:** +15% Amount Modifier for Wood.
*   **Winter:** +5% Amount Modifier for Wood.
*   **Spring:** -5% Amount Modifier for Wood.

### Strategic Importance

*   **Exploration:** Trading with the Lizards unlocks the **Trade tab**, which allows you to **Send Explorers** to find additional civilizations.
*   **Rare Resources:** Any successful trade, including those with Lizards, has a fixed **10% chance of receiving one Blueprint** and a **35% chance of receiving Spice** as extra resources.

### Advanced Relations Policies

Once you reach Lizard Embassy Level 20 and research the [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "policies/Diplomacy.md" >}}) Metaphysics upgrade, you unlock specialized foreign policies related to the Lizard civilization:

1.  **Lizard Relations: Ecologists:** Reduces pollution by 5%.
2.  **Lizard Relations: Priests:** Causes Manuscripts to grant maximum faith equal to the maximum culture they grant (though this reduces maximum culture by 25%).
3.  **Lizard Relations: Diplomats:** Increases the standing ratio by +0.1% per Embassy built with neutral races, which can help those neutral races become Friendly.
