Based on the sources, the following civilizations (races) exist in *Kittens Game* and have specific requirements for their discovery, often tied to game time or technological milestones:

| Civilization (Race) | Initial Attitude | Requirement for Discovery | Notes on Timing/Unlock |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lizards** | Friendly (+25%) | **Year 20** | This baseline can be reduced to **Year 5** if you have accumulated **>0 Karma**, or to **Year 1** with the **Diplomacy Metaphysics upgrade**. |
| **Sharks** | Neutral (0%) | **Year 20** | This baseline can be reduced to **Year 5** if you have accumulated **>0 Karma**, or to **Year 1** with the **Diplomacy Metaphysics upgrade**. |
| **Griffins** | Hostile (-15%) | **Year 20** | This baseline can be reduced to **Year 5** if you have accumulated **>0 Karma**, or to **Year 1** with the **Diplomacy Metaphysics upgrade**. |
| **Nagas** | Neutral (0%) | **1500 Culture**. | To unlock the Nagas, you generally need 1500 culture cap, often achieved by maximizing libraries and building Amphitheatres and Academies. |
| **Zebras** | Hostile (-30%) | **1 Trade Ship** | Discovery requires sending explorers, which costs 1,000 Catpower. |
| **Spiders** | Friendly (+15%) | **100 Trade Ships** and **125k Max Science** | Spiders trade coal and oil for scaffold. |
| **Dragons** | Neutral (0%) | **Nuclear Fission** technology | Dragons trade uranium and thorium for titanium. |
| **Leviathans** | Neutral (0%) | **Black Pyramid** | Unlocking Leviathans does not make them permanent traders, and they trade unobtainium for rare resources like Time Crystals and Relics. |

### Discovery Mechanism

Once trading is unlocked, you can discover additional civilizations by **Sending Explorers**. This action costs **1,000 Catpower**, though 950 Catpower is refunded if no trading partner is found (in the web version).

### Racial Attitudes and Benefits

The attitude of a civilization affects trade outcomes:

*   **Friendly** civilizations have a chance of giving you **15–25% extra resources** during a trade ("Race think your kittens are adorable"). Lizards and Spiders are initially friendly.
*   **Hostile** civilizations may give you **nothing at all** ("Race hate you for no reason"). Griffins and Zebras are initially hostile.
*   The **Caravanserai** upgrade (unlocked via Navigation and purchased using Trade Depots) can improve race relations, decreasing the hostile event probability and increasing the friendly event probability.

The Diplomacy Metaphysics upgrade specifically enhances initial standing, noting that Diplomacy increases the standing ratio by 10.
