[Dragons]( {{< relref "trade/Dragons.md" >}}) are a neutral trading civilization in *Kittens Game* that are crucial for acquiring Uranium and Thorium, essential resources for progressing into the space and atomic phases of the game.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Dragons and their strategic importance:

### Prerequisites and Attitude

*   [Attitude:]( {{< relref "trade/Attitude.md" >}}) Dragons are a **Neutral** civilization, starting with a 0% attitude towards your kittens.
*   **Unlocking:** Dragons are unlocked once you have researched the [Nuclear Fission]( {{< relref "techs/Nuclear_Fission.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Trade Requirements:** To trade with Dragons, you must **buy** Uranium or Thorium by offering [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}). The minimum cost they require is 250 Titanium.

### Resources Traded

Dragons specialize in selling advanced radioactive resources:

| Resource Sold | Minimum Amount | Chance to Receive | Strategic Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Uranium]( {{< relref "resource/uranium.md" >}}) | 1 | 95% | Uranium is a Common Resource. |
| [Thorium]( {{< relref "resource/thorium.md" >}}) | 1 | 50% | Thorium is sold once you reach Embassy Level 5. |

Dragon trades do **not** have any seasonal adjustments that affect the amount of resources received.

### Strategic Role and Uranium Acquisition

The primary function of trading with Dragons is to gain [Uranium]( {{< relref "resource/uranium.md" >}}), which is necessary for creating Unobtainium (UO) and for powering Reactors.

1.  **Unobtainium Production:** The [Lunar Outpost]( {{< relref "planet/lunar_outpost.md" >}}) converts Uranium into Unobtainium. Since the Lunar Outpost consumes Uranium at a rate 140 times faster than a single [Accelerator]( {{< relref "buildings/Accelerator.md" >}}) can produce it internally, trading Titanium for Uranium with Dragons provides a vital alternative source for this bottleneck resource.
2.  **Thorium Acquisition:** Dragons are a source for [Thorium]( {{< relref "resource/thorium.md" >}}), a highly radioactive and unstable fuel. Thorium is used for the [Thorium Reactors]( {{< relref "upgrade/Thorium_Reactors.md" >}}) upgrade and the [Thorium Drive]( {{< relref "upgrade/Thorium_Drive.md" >}}) space engine upgrade.
3.  **Embassy Bonus:** If you build Embassies with the Dragons, the chance to receive [Uranium]( {{< relref "resource/uranium.md" >}}) increases, reaching a guaranteed 100% chance at Embassy Level 6.

In the progression towards [Metaphysics]( {{< relref "techs/Metaphysics.md" >}}), where you need Unobtainium, you will need to research Nuclear Fission to unlock Dragons. Trading with Dragons to acquire Uranium, which then converts to Unobtainium via the Lunar Outpost, is a standard path forward.

The reliance on Dragons for Uranium highlights the constant trade-offs in resource management: you exchange your hard-won [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) (acquired mainly through trading with the hostile Zebras) for the prerequisite resource [Uranium]( {{< relref "resource/uranium.md" >}}) needed for the next technological jump to Unobtainium.
