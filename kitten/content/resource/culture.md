Culture is a **special expendable resource** in *Kittens Game*. It is essential for technological progression, particularly during the transition from the early to mid-game phases.

Culture is critical because it is required to craft **Manuscripts**, which are necessary prerequisites for several key technologies, including **Theology** and **Astronomy**.

### Production of Culture

Culture is primarily generated by specialized cultural and religious buildings:

*   **Amphitheatres**: These are unlocked after researching **Writing**. They generate **+0.005 Culture per Tick**. Amphitheatres can be upgraded to **Broadcast Towers**, which significantly increase culture per tick based on your energy surplus.
*   **Temples**: Unlocked by **Philosophy**, Temples generate **+0.1 Culture per Tick**.
*   **Chapels**: Unlocked by **Acoustics**, Chapels generate **+0.05 Culture per Tick**.

Culture production can be further boosted through religious upgrades, policies, and game cycles:

*   **Stained Glass**: This upgrade (which costs 500 Faith and 250 Gold, and requires 750 Worship) enhances Temple functionality by increasing their culture output by **+0.05 Culture per Tick**. This bonus increases by an additional +0.05 for each subsequent level purchased using Transcendence.
*   **Basilica**: This upgrade, available after accumulating 10,000 Worship, increases Temple culture per tick by **+0.2**.
*   **Mysticism Policy**: This policy provides a **+5% culture and faith production** bonus.
*   **Cultural Exchange Policy**: This policy grants a **+5% culture income** bonus.
*   **Yarn Cycle**: If **Numeromancy** is researched, holding a festival during the **Yarn** cycle grants a Culture income **x2** bonus.

Like other special resources, Culture production benefits from Paragon and Religion production boosts.

### Usage and Progression

Culture is used exclusively in the Workshop tab to craft **Manuscripts**.

1.  **Crafting Manuscripts:** To craft one Manuscript, you typically require **25 Parchment** and **400 Culture**. This cost can be reduced if you adopt the **Tradition Policy**, which reduces the cost to **20 Parchment** and **300 Culture**.
2.  **Unlocking Advanced Tech:** Manuscripts are vital for unlocking mid-game sciences:
    *   **Theology** requires 20,000 Science and **35 Manuscripts**.
    *   **Astronomy** requires 28,000 Science and **65 Manuscripts**.

The sources highlight that reaching the Theology science is gated by the steep requirement of needing to create Manuscripts using Parchment and Culture, a resource that accumulates slowly at first.

### Storage Capacity

Culture is a capped resource, with an initial storage capacity of **100**. Expanding this limit is necessary for accumulating enough culture to craft expensive manuscripts.

Maximum Culture capacity is increased by buildings and upgrades:

*   **Library**: +10 max culture.
*   **Academy**: +25 max culture.
*   **Amphitheatre**: +50 max culture.
*   **Chapel**: +200 max culture.
*   **Data Center** (Library upgrade): +250 max culture.
*   **Basilica** (Temple upgrade): +125 max culture to Temples, increasing by +50 per additional level via Transcendence.
*   **Ziggurat**: +8% max culture.
*   **Broadcast Tower** (Amphitheatre upgrade): Max Culture + (300 multiplied by the Energy Surplus Ratio).
*   **Unicorn Graveyard** (Religious building): Increases maximum culture by +1% per Ziggurat.
*   **Codex Logos** (Metaphysics upgrade): Increases the Manuscript craft multiplier, which grants a minor bonus to maximum culture (with diminishing returns).

Accumulating enough Culture capacity is also necessary to interact with certain trade partners, as the Nagas are unlocked when you reach a **1500 Culture cap**.

To progress through the initial difficulty of Culture accumulation, many players focus on building Amphitheatres and Temples and maximize their ability to hunt for Furs (which are refined into Parchment) to ensure they can sustain Manuscript production.

# How toincrease Culture

### 1. Primary Production Buildings

The production of Culture is generated by specific structures, which are unlocked as you progress through the Science tree:

| Building | Prerequisite Technology | Culture Per Tick | Max Culture Increase |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Amphitheatre** | **Writing** [5] | +0.005 [6] | +50 [6] |
| **Chapel** | **Acoustics** [7] | +0.05 [6] | +200 [6] |
| **Temple** | **Philosophy** (which unlocks Theology) [4] | +0.1 [6] | N/A (increases Faith cap instead) [6] |

### 2. Upgraded Production and Efficiency

Culture generation can be significantly boosted by upgrading buildings and purchasing religious and Workshop upgrades:

*   **Broadcast Tower (Amphitheatre Upgrade):** This is an upgrade available after researching **Electronics** [8]. A single Broadcast Tower can increase production as much as **two hundred** times compared to an Amphitheatre [9].
    *   It produces **Culture per Tick** based on the Energy Surplus Ratio [10].
    *   The **Satellite Radio** upgrade further boosts the Broadcast Tower's culture per tick and max culture by **+0.5% per active Satellite** [11].
*   **Temple Upgrades:**
    *   **Stained Glass** (Religion Upgrade): Temples produce an additional **+0.05 culture per tick** (+0.05 per additional level via Transcendence) [12].
    *   **Basilica** (Religion Upgrade): Temples produce an additional **+0.2 culture per tick** (+0.05 per additional level via Transcendence) [13].
*   **Cycles:** If you have researched **Numeromancy** [14], running a Festival during the **Yarn** cycle will multiply Culture income by **x2** [15].

### 3. Culture Storage (Max Culture)

The initial default storage capacity for Culture is **100** [16]. This limit can be increased through several means:

| Source | Max Culture Increase | Prerequisite |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Amphitheatre** | +50 [6] | Writing [5] |
| **Library** | +10 [17] | N/A |
| **Academy** | +25 [17] | Mathematics [18] |
| **Chapel** | +200 [6] | Acoustics [7] |
| **Ziggurat** | +8% Max Culture [19] | Construction [18] |
| **Manuscripts** | Provides a minor bonus (subject to diminishing returns) [2]. | N/A |
| **Data Center (Library Upgrade)** | +250 [10]. | Electronics [8] |
| **Broadcast Tower (Amphitheatre Upgrade)** | +($300 \times$ Energy Surplus Ratio) [10]. | Electronics [8] |
| **Basilica (Temple Upgrade)** | Temples gain +125 max culture (+50 per additional level via Transcendence) [13]. | Worship 10K [13] |
| **Policy: City On A Hill** | +5% culture cap [20]. | Isolationism [20] |
| **Data Center/Bio Lab Synergy:** | **Uplink** increases the max culture of Data Centers by +1% per Bio Lab [21]. | Satellites [21] |

### 4. Production Boosting Policies

Culture production is also influenced by selecting certain policies:

*   **Mysticism:** Provides a **+5% culture and faith production** bonus [22].
*   **Cultural Exchange:** Provides a **+5% culture income** bonus [23].

### 5. Culture Consumption (Manuscripts)

Culture is required to craft **Manuscripts** [1, 2]. Each Manuscript typically requires 400 Culture and 25 Parchment [2].

*   The **Tradition** policy, available after researching Writing, is recommended for culture-oriented societies as it reduces the Manuscript cost by **100 culture and 5 parchment**, and doubles the manuscript's effect on maximum culture [2, 24, 25].

A key progression bottleneck in the mid-game involves creating Manuscripts, and since Culture accumulates slowly at first [3], you must focus on building **Amphitheatres** and **Temples** to increase generation rates [26, 27]. The resource is further affected by **Paragon** and **Religion** production boosts [28].

To visualize the early focus on culture production, consider it like building a sustainable theater industry: You start with a few small Amphitheatres (local playhouses), eventually upgrade to Chapels and Temples (larger venues with dedicated staff), and ultimately deploy Broadcast Towers (mass media/streaming services) to dramatically amplify output and r
