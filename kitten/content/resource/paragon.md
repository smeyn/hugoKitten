[Paragon]( {{< relref "paragon.md" >}}) is a unique, persistent resource in *Kittens Game* that is fundamental to the game's prestige system, allowing players to purchase permanent upgrades that make subsequent runs easier [1].

### Acquisition and Persistence

Paragon is primarily acquired by reaching a certain population level before resetting the game [2]:

*   You gain Paragon upon reset if you have **more than 70 kittens** [3, 4].
*   The reward is **one point per kitten over 70** [3].
*   Paragon is also gained at a passive rate of **+1 for every 1,000 years** that pass in the game [3].
*   Paragon, along with **burned paragon**, **carries over** after every game reset [5].

### Primary Purpose: The Metaphysics System

Paragon is the currency used to purchase permanent enhancements in the [Metaphysics]( {{< relref "metaphysics.md" >}}) tab [6]. The Metaphysics system itself must be researched again each run, but the purchased upgrades persist [6].

The central function of Metaphysics upgrades is to reduce the cost growth of buildings, often referred to as **price ratio reduction**, allowing players to buy "lots more stuff" [6-8]. This reduction only applies to buildings in the **Bonfire tab** [6].

Key Metaphysics upgrades and their Paragon costs include:

| Upgrade Category | Upgrade Name | Paragon Cost | Purpose/Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Price Ratio Reduction** | **Enlightenment** | 5 [6] | Reduces all price ratios by 1% [6]. |
| | **Golden Ratio** | 50 [9] | Reduces price ratios by approximately 1.618% [9]. |
| | **Divine Proportion** | 100 [10] | Reduces price ratios by approximately 1.777% [10]. |
| | **Vitruvian Feline** | 250 [10] | Reduces price ratios by 2% [10]. |
| | **Renaissance** | 750 [10] | Reduces price ratios by 2.25% [10]. |
| **QoL/Progression** | [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "diplomacy.md" >}}) | 5 [10] | Races are discovered earlier and with better standing [10]. |
| | **Anachronomancy** | 125 [11] | Saves **Time Crystals and Chronophysics** technology across resets [11]. |
| | **Megalomania** | 10 [9] | Unlocks late-game Unicorn mechanics (Markers and Black Pyramids) [9]. |
| | **Adjustment Bureau** | 5 [12] | Unlocks **Challenges** [12, 13]. |

### Effects on Production and Storage

Paragon provides substantial, permanent boosts to your civilization:

*   **Production Boost:** Paragon generally increases production rates [2, 14]. However, the production benefit experiences **diminishing returns** [4]. Once a player reaches about **150 Paragon**, the effectiveness starts to decrease [4]. For example, 150 Paragon provides a 150% production increase, but 400 Paragon only increases it to 190% [4].
*   **Storage Boost:** Paragon increases resource storage capacity, and this effect **never diminishes** [15]. High levels of Paragon are crucial for bypassing major storage bottlenecks [15]. Specifically, Paragon boosts **Moon Bases and Cryostations** storage by 0.1% per Paragon [16].
*   **Space Production:** It is noted that Paragon has **no effect** on the production of space structures [17].

### Burned Paragon

Players have the option to "burn" Paragon, which is useful for specialized runs and stacking bonuses [4, 18]:

*   **Effectiveness:** Burned Paragon has **half the effectiveness** of regular Paragon [4], but it stacks with regular Paragon [4]. The production gain from the first 75 burned Paragon gives a 1% production gain and is additive to the normal Paragon bonus [19].
*   **Strategy:** It is suggested that players aiming for maximum efficiency burn Paragon once they reach around **400 regular Paragon** [19]. The boost from burned Paragon is particularly important in the **Iron Will** challenge mode, where the Metaphysics price ratio upgrades are still beneficial [18].

### End Game Scaling

In the very late game, Paragon scaling can be improved through high-cost Metaphysics upgrades called **Sefirot metas** (e.g., Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, etc.) [20]. These upgrades cost between 500 Paragon (Malkuth) and 60,000 Paragon (Keter) [12, 21]. Each Sefirot meta improves Paragon effect and scaling by **5%** [12, 21].

For players pursuing extreme end-game goals, specific strategies exist for rapid Paragon generation, such as the "cryo engine" method, which can yield up to **15 million Paragon per day** [22].


You accumulate paragon primarily through two mechanisms: resetting your game based on your kitten population, and through the passage of time [5, 6].

### Primary Methods of Accumulation

1.  **Resetting with Kittens:** Paragon is gained when you **reset the game if you have more than 70 kittens** [5-7]. You earn one paragon point for every kitten beyond the initial 70 [7].
    *   Resetting the game is considered the fifth step in the basic gameplay cycle, occurring when progress becomes too slow [5].
    *   For your first reset, it is recommended to aim for 130 or more kittens to secure at least 60 paragon [8]. Subsequent runs aim for higher kitten counts, such as 170+ for 100 paragon, or 220+ for 150 paragon [8].

2.  **Time Passage:** You are granted **+1 paragon for every 1,000 years that pass** in the game [6].

### Advanced and End-Game Accumulation

In the later stages of the game, players utilize highly efficient methods to generate massive amounts of paragon:

*   **Mass Shatterings (Time Skipping):** You can gain paragon rapidly by advancing time using Time Crystals (TCs) and the Chronoforge or Time Boilers. This method yields **1 paragon for every thousand years skipped** [9]. This technique is sometimes referred to as the "Shatter Engine" [9, 10].
*   **The Holy Genocide Upgrade:** Once you reach Transcendence-Tier 25 and purchase the Holy Genocide cryptotheology upgrade, resetting grants a **+2% increase in paragon gained per kitten** [11].
*   **The Cryo Engine:** A late-game technique involving resetting while possessing 3,000 Cryochambers is theorised to yield approximately **15 million paragon per day** [12].
*   **Mass Kitten Accumulation:** Utilizing Festivals, especially when combined with the Terraformation mission upgrade "Tempus Fugit" (not explicitly detailed how it works with festivals in the source, but mentioned in context), to rapidly grow a large kitten population (e.g., ~60,000 kittens) can yield up to **120,000 paragon per day** [9].

Once accumulated, paragon is used to purchase Metaphysics upgrades such as the **price ratio reduction upgrades** (e.g., Enlightenment, Golden Ratio, Divine Proportion, Vitruvian Feline, and Renaissance), which make buildings cheaper in future runs [2, 13-15].

***

**Analogy:** Accumulating paragon is like **cashing in your retirement savings** (your current civilization) to gain a permanent, compounding financial head start (Metaphysics bonuses and production boosts) for your next business venture (the next run). The more investment you put into your current civilization (getting more than 70 kittens), the larger the bonus you get for the next startup. In the end-game, you learn to **manipulate time itself** to fast-forward through years and maximize these compounded benefits.
