[Alicorns]( {{< relref "resource/alicorn.md" >}}) are a unique, late-game resource in *Kittens Game*, categorized as a **Unique Resource** [1]. They are crucial for progressing into the Time Crystal era of the game.

Here is a detailed overview of their mechanics, acquisition, and uses:

### 1. Resource Type and Persistence

Alicorns are classified as a **Luxury Resource**, which means they are **always lost upon reset** (along with Furs, Ivory, and Unicorns) [1, 2].

### 2. Acquisition and Production

Alicorns are not produced by standard jobs or early buildings; they are acquired through late-game religious structures and rare events:

*   [Sky Palaces:]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Sky_Palace.md" >}}) This religious building, which requires Tears, Ivory, and Megalith to construct, is the main way to gain Alicorns [3].
    *   Building a Sky Palace enables a random event that grants one Alicorn, and each palace increases the frequency of this event by **$0.01\%$ per game-day** [3].
    *   Sky Palaces also passively produce **$0.00002$ alicorns per tick** ($0.08$ per year) [3].
*   [Unicorn Utopia:]( {{< relref "unicorn_utopia.md" >}}) This subsequent unicorn religious upgrade improves alicorn summon chance by **$0.015\%$ per game-day** and increases passive production to **$0.000025$ alicorns per tick** [4].
*   **Pacifism Challenge Reward:** Completing the Pacifism challenge provides an increasing reward, including a **$+10\%$ Alicorn chance** per completion (up to $120\%$) and a **$10\%$ increase to Alicorn per tick production** (with no diminishing returns) [5].

### 3. Primary Uses and Conversion

Alicorns are primarily consumed to generate [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "time_crystals.md" >}}) (TC), a valuable prestige resource:

*   **Sacrifice for Time Crystals:** You can **Sacrifice 25 Alicorns** to receive **1 Time Crystal** [6].
    *   The conversion ratio is improved by the religious upgrades [Unicorn Utopia]( {{< relref "unicorn_utopia.md" >}}) (+5\%) and [Sunspire]( {{< relref "sunspire.md" >}}) (+10\%) [4, 6].
    *   The act is described as "Banish the alicorns to the Bloodmoon" [6].
*   **Resource Retrieval Strategy:** In the end game, acquiring enough levels of the **Resource Retrieval** upgrade means shattering a Time Crystal will yield enough unobtainium and [alicorns]( {{< relref "resource/alicorn.md" >}}) to allow the player to trade/sacrifice immediately for new Time Crystals, sustaining the flow of this resource [7].

### 4. Consumption and Corruption

Alicorns are consumed or corrupted in three ways:

*   **Necrocorn Corruption:** The religious building [Marker]( {{< relref "marker.md" >}}) starts a process that slowly changes alicorns into **Necrocorns** [1, 8].
*   [Unicorn Necropolis:]( {{< relref "unicorn_necropolis.md" >}}) The [Unicorn Necropolis]( {{< relref "unicorn_necropolis.md" >}}) building, an advanced religious structure, requires **100 Alicorn** (along with Necrocorn, Megalith, and Void) [9].
*   **Ivory Temple Consumption:** The [Ivory Temple]( {{< relref "ivory_temple.md" >}}), a building related to Zebras, consumes $0.00002$ alicorns per tick while converting Ivory to Minerals [10].

In terms of strategy, it is advised to conserve your alicorn supply until the "last moment" to maximize the Time Crystal conversion ratio, particularly during a final run before a reset [11].
