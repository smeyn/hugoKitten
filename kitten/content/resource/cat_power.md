Based on the sources, **Catpower** (a special resource generated by the [Hunter]( {{< relref "hunter.md" >}}) profession [1, 2]) is reduced primarily through its consumption by game mechanics, including hunting, trade, and certain buildings.

Here are the specific actions and costs that reduce your Catpower:

### 1. Consumption for Hunting

The primary and initial use of Catpower is for hunting:

*   Each time you initiate a hunt (after researching [Archery]( {{< relref "archery.md" >}}) [1]), it costs **100 Catpower** [2, 3].
*   Hunting allows you the chance to gather rare resources like [Furs]( {{< relref "resource/Fur.md" >}}) and [Ivory]( {{< relref "resource/ivory.md" >}}) [3, 4].

### 2. Consumption for Trade and Exploration

Catpower is necessary for diplomatic actions and trade:

*   **Exploring:** Sending explorers to find new races costs **1,000 Catpower** [5, 6].
    *   If no trading partner is found during the exploration attempt, **950 Catpower is refunded** (in the web version of the game) [5, 6].
*   [Trading:]( {{< relref "guides/trading.md" >}}) Diplomacy is a Policy option that, if chosen, makes trades cheaper in terms of Catpower, reducing the cost by **5 Catpower per trade** [7]. (The standard cost per trade is not explicitly stated in Catpower units, but the diplomacy policy affects it [7]).

### 3. Consumption by Buildings

One building consumes Catpower passively while active:

*   [Mint:]( {{< relref "mint.md" >}}) The [Mint]( {{< relref "mint.md" >}}) building, unlocked by researching Architecture [8], consumes Catpower at a rate of **$0.75$ per tick** [9].

### 4. Challenge Restriction

In addition to consumption, the maximum available Catpower can be reduced by challenges:

*   **Atheism Challenge (Increasing Challenge):** For each completion of the Atheism challenge after the first run, the maximum Catpower will decrease by **125** [10].

### Summary of Catpower Management

Catpower is a vital early-game resource for obtaining luxury items (furs, ivory, unicorns) [4, 11, 12] and for finding new trade partners [5]. High Catpower limits are necessary for purchasing certain religion upgrades like [Templars]( {{< relref "templars.md" >}}), which increase Max Catpower by 75 per Temple [13]. Therefore, actions that consume Catpower should be balanced by its production through [Hunters]( {{< relref "job/Hunter.md" >}}) (+$0.06$ per tick) [1].
