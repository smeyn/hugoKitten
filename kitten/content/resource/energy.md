Power generation, referred to in the game as **Energy**, is produced by specific advanced buildings and structures, typically unlocked starting in the mid-game, and becomes increasingly important as pollution and energy consumption penalties become factors [1-3].

Here is a breakdown of the buildings that produce Energy:

### Buildings Producing Energy

| Building/Upgrade | Technology Prerequisite | Energy Produced (Base) | Notes | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Steamworks** | Machinery | +1 Wt | This building consumes coal, and the **High Pressure Engine** and **Fuel Injector** upgrades reduce its coal consumption [4-7]. | [4] |
| **Magneto** | Electricity | +5 Wt | This building consumes oil at a rate of $0.05$ per tick [4, 8]. | [4] |
| **Solar Farm** (Upgrade of Pasture) | Ecology | +2 Wt | Solar Farms are safer to upgrade to than Hydro Plants. They produce **+1.5 Wt in Winter** and **+2.67 Wt in Summer** [9-11]. | [9] |
| **Hydro Plant** (Upgrade of Aqueduct) | Robotics | +5 Wt | Upgrading Aqueducts to Hydro Plants should be approached cautiously as it can lead to starvation if catnip production is insufficient [9, 11, 12]. | [9] |
| **Reactor** | Nuclear Fission | +10 Wt | Reactors consume uranium at a rate of $0.001$ per tick [4, 13]. | [4] |
| **Satellite** | Satellites | +1 Wt | Satellites initially consume 1 Wt, but with the **Solar Satellites** upgrade (unlocked by Orbital Engineering), they produce **+1 Wt** instead of consuming it [7]. | [7, 9, 14] |
| **Sunlifter** | N/A (Space Structure) | N/A (Antimatter) | Sunlifters produce Antimatter when the year changes, provided energy is positive [15]. | [15] |
| **Advanced Energy Challenge Buildings** | N/A | N/A | The **Energy** challenge requires unlocking and building at least one of every energy production building and space structure, which includes **Steamworks, Magneto, Solar Farms, Hydro Plant, Reactor, Satellite, Sunlifter, Tectonic, and HR Harvester** [3]. | [3] |

### Energy Boosts and Management

Energy production and consumption can be managed through various upgrades and cycles:

*   **Reactor Upgrades:** The **Cold Fusion** upgrade increases Reactor energy output by **2.5 Wt** (+25%) [16]. The **Thorium Reactors** upgrade also increases Reactor energy output by $0.25$ Wt (+25%) [16].
*   **Solar Farm Upgrades:** **Photovoltaic Cells** increase Solar Farm energy production by **+50%** [7]. **Thin Film Cells** and **Quantum Dot Cells** provide further percentage increases, especially in specific seasons [7].
*   **Oil Wells:** The **Pumpjack** upgrade for Oil Wells increases oil output by 45% and causes Oil Wells to consume **1 Wt** of energy [16].
*   **Cycles:** The **Helios** cycle increases **Sunlifter** energy output by **+50%** [17]. Conversely, the **T-minus** cycle decreases **Sunlifter** energy output by **-50%** [17].
*   **Policies:** The **Dark Nova** cryptotheology upgrade provides a **+2% global energy production** bonus [18].

Maintaining positive energy is vital, as a negative energy balance will result in production penalties [3, 19]. Pollution is partially mitigated by using environmentally friendly energy sources [2].
