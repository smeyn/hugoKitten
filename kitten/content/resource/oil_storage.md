The storage limit for **Oil** starts at a base capacity and can be increased through the construction of specific buildings and the crafting of specialized items.

Here is a breakdown of how to increase your Oil storage capacity:

### Base Oil Storage

The initial, default storage capacity for Oil is **1,500** [1].

### Increasing Oil Storage Capacity

You can increase the maximum limit of Oil through the following methods:

1.  **Oil Wells:** The building used to produce oil, the **Oil Well**, also increases your maximum oil storage. Each Oil Well provides **+1500 Max Oil** [2].

2.  **Tankers (Crafted Ships):** Oil storage can be significantly increased by crafting and building **Tankers**.
    *   A **Tanker** is a crafted item that increases the **maximum oil capacity by 500** [3, 4].
    *   Tankers are crafted in the Workshop, requiring **200 Ships**, **1,250 Alloy**, and **5 Blueprints** [4].
    *   The ability to craft Tankers is unlocked by researching **Robotics** science [4, 5].

3.  **Space Structures:** Late-game structures contribute to storage, particularly when combined with specific Metaphysics upgrades:
    *   **Cryostation:** This structure's storage capacity is affected by the **T-minus** cycle, which can provide a **+20%** boost to its storage [6, 7].
    *   **Cryostations** are a highly useful method for increasing resource capacity, providing **+750** Titanium storage per unit, among other resources [7].

### Strategic Considerations for Oil Storage

In the latter stages of the game, particularly during the push toward **Metaphysics** and space missions, acquiring sufficient Oil capacity is a significant bottleneck [8]:

*   The **Lunar Outpost** mission requires **55K oil storage** [9].
*   The **Orbital Launch** requires **15K oil**, the **Moon Mission** requires **45K oil**, and the subsequent **Moon Base** requires **70K oil** [8, 10].
*   The general strategy suggested is to **build Oil Wells quickly** and let them "fill up," then buy space structures as soon as possible so the wells have time to refill [8, 11].
*   The upgrade **Oil Distillation**, unlocked by **Rocketry**, boosts oil production by 75%, which helps in replenishing the stock, but does not increase the maximum capacity [8, 12].

As you progress, the primary focus shifts to crafting and building **Tankers** and later utilizing advanced structures like **Cryostations** to meet the large oil capacity requirements [7, 13, 14].
