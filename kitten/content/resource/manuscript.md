The [Manuscript]( {{< relref "resource/manuscript.md" >}}) is a critical mid-game crafted resource that serves as a bottleneck for advancing the main scientific and religious technology trees in *Kittens Game*.

Here is a detailed overview of Manuscripts, their production, cost, and vital strategic role:

### 1. Acquisition and Crafting

Manuscripts are produced in the Workshop by converting the precursor resource, Parchment, using the resource Culture.

| Input Resource | Base Cost per Manuscript | Cost with [Tradition]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}) Policy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Parchment]( {{< relref "craft/Parchment.md" >}}) (Crafted from Furs) | 25 units | 20 units |
| [Culture]( {{< relref "resource/culture.md" >}}) (Generated by Amphitheatres/Temples) | 400 units | 300 units |

Manuscripts are required to continue the technology line after [Philosophy]( {{< relref "science/Philosophy.md" >}}).

#### Production Sources and Boosts

*   **Parchment Generation:** Parchment must be crafted from [Furs]( {{< relref "resource/Fur.md" >}}). Furs are acquired through **Hunting** using Catpower. Players are advised to **Begin Crafting Parchment as Often as You Can** well before they are required, as a significant amount will be needed.
*   **Culture Generation:** [Culture]( {{< relref "resource/culture.md" >}}) is generated by [Amphitheatres]( {{< relref "buildings/Amphitheatre.md" >}}) and [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}). Culture accumulation is slow initially.
*   **Automation (Steamworks):** The [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}) building (unlocked by Machinery) can automatically print manuscripts. The [Printing Press]( {{< relref "upgrade/Printing_Press.md" >}}) upgrade allows Steamworks to produce **0.0025 manuscripts/sec**. This can be multiplied by subsequent upgrades like [Offset Press]( {{< relref "upgrade/Offset_Press.md" >}}) and [Photolithography]( {{< relref "upgrade/Photolithography.md" >}}).
*   **Trade:** Manuscripts can sometimes be obtained by trading with [Sharks]( {{< relref "trade/Sharks.md" >}}). Sharks offer 3 Manuscripts with a 15% chance if you have an Embassy Level of 10.
*   **Policy Bonus:** The [Tradition]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}) policy reduces the manuscript cost by **100 culture and 5 parchment**, and it **doubles the manuscript maximum culture effect**. Choosing Tradition is generally recommended to accelerate the manuscript grind.

### 2. Strategic Importance and Uses

Manuscripts represent the primary bottleneck in the early-to-mid game, transitioning resource focus from Wood/Minerals toward cultural and faith production.

*   **Technology Advancement:** Manuscripts are necessary inputs for critical mid-game sciences:
    *   [Theology:]( {{< relref "science/theology.md" >}}) Requires **35 Manuscripts**.
    *   [Astronomy:]( {{< relref "techs/Astronomy.md" >}}) Requires **65 Manuscripts**.
    *   [Navigation:]( {{< relref "techs/Navigation.md" >}}) Requires **100 Manuscripts**.
*   **Next Tier Crafting:** Manuscripts are refined in the Workshop, along with Science, to produce [Compendiums]( {{< relref "Compendium.md" >}}). Compendiums are prerequisites for technologies like Architecture, Physics, and Geology.
*   **Blueprint Production:** Eventually, Compendiums are crafted into [Blueprints]( {{< relref "resource/Blueprint.md" >}}), making manuscripts foundational to the late-game crafting resource chain.
*   **Temple Building:** Manuscripts are required to construct [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}). A single Temple costs **10 Manuscripts**.
*   **Culture Capacity:** Manuscripts grant a minor bonus to the maximum capacity of [Culture]( {{< relref "resource/culture.md" >}}), though this effect is subject to diminishing returns.
*   **Lizard Relations:** The **Lizard Relations: Priests** policy allows manuscripts to grant maximum [Faith]( {{< relref "resource/faith.md" >}}) equal to the maximum culture they grant, while reducing the maximum culture they provide by 25%.

### 3. Overcoming the Manuscript Grind

The necessary manuscript volume creates a "fair bump" in progression. To efficiently grind manuscripts:

1.  **Maximize Capacity:** Max out your kitten population using Huts and Log Houses to increase Catpower limits and production rate (for hunting furs).
2.  **Increase Culture:** Build as many [Amphitheatres]( {{< relref "buildings/Amphitheatre.md" >}}) and [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}) as reasonably possible, and buy all available culture and catpower bonuses from the Religion tab. Culture generating buildings like Amphitheatres, Academies, and Libraries also boost the culture storage cap, which is often constrained.
3.  **Boost Crafting:** Maximizing your [Workshops]( {{< relref "buildings/Workshop.md" >}}) is essential, as this provides a multiplicative bonus to all crafting operations, including manuscript creation.
4.  **Kitten Allocation:** A suggested method for grinding is to temporarily move all kittens to [Hunters]( {{< relref "job/Hunter.md" >}}) to generate a massive stockpile of [Parchment]( {{< relref "craft/Parchment.md" >}}) (since Parchment creation should initially outpace culture consumption), then craft manuscripts whenever your Culture storage maxes out.

### Persistence on Reset

Manuscripts are classified as **Craftable Resources**. They are generally lost upon reset, but they can be conditionally carried over if the player has [Chronospheres]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}) and the [Flux Condensator]( {{< relref "upgrade/Flux_Condensator.md" >}}) upgrade. Each Chronosphere preserves $1.5\% \times 100 \times \sqrt{X}$ of the resource, where $X$ is the amount before reset, meaning they carry over with diminishing returns.

In the accelerated, late-game reset loop, stocking up on crafted resources like manuscripts is essential for quickly getting back up to speed. For example, stocking **19.6k manuscripts** is recommended for maximizing resource carryover using one Chronosphere.
