Science is a critical resource in *Kittens Game*, essential for technological advancement, unlocking new capabilities, and progressing to later stages of the game.

Here is an explanation of how Science is acquired, its uses, and how its capacity is managed:

### Acquisition and Production

Science is categorized as a **Special Resource**. Its accumulation is boosted by global factors, including **Paragon** and **Religion production boosts**.

1.  **Kitten Jobs:** Science is primarily generated by the **Scholar** profession. You should employ Scholars to ensure continuous accumulation, as Techs are crucial for progression.
2.  **Buildings:** Science production is generated by several buildings:
    *   **Library** (unlocked at 25 Wood): Provides +10% Science per tick.
    *   **Academy** (unlocked by Mathematics): Provides +20% Science per tick.
    *   **Observatory** (unlocked by Astronomy): Provides +25% Science per tick.
    *   **Bio Lab** (unlocked by Biology): Provides +35% Science per tick.
    *   **Data Center**: An upgrade to the Library, it also provides +10% Science per tick.
3.  **Events:** You can gain Science by observing **astronomical events**. After building your first Library, these events have a chance to occur daily. Meteors also grant minerals and science. The **Celestial Mechanics** upgrade grants an additional **20% bonus** to science generated by celestial events and meteors (60% bonus in Iron Will mode).
4.  **Policies:** Policies such as **Rationality** (+5% science production) and **Knowledge Sharing** (+5% science income) can increase accumulation rates.

### Usage and Role in Progression

Science is essential for expanding your civilization by unlocking new content.

1.  **Purchasing Technologies (Techs):** Science is spent to purchase Techs, which grant new information and abilities. Techs must generally be unlocked in sequence, and they are crucial for game progression. However, the cost of sciences escalates very quickly, and players should avoid prioritizing new sciences too aggressively before securing production and caps.
2.  **Crafting Advanced Resources:** Science is required in the Workshop tab for converting intermediate resources into higher-tier resources:
    *   **Compendium:** Crafted from 50 **Manuscripts** and **10,000 Science**. Compendiums improve the maximum science limit.
    *   **Blueprint:** Crafted from 25 **Compendiums** and **25,000 Science**. Blueprints are required for late-game technologies and automated industry buildings like the Steamworks.
3.  **Workshop Upgrades:** Science is a resource used to buy various permanent upgrades in the Workshop tab.

### Science Capacity and Storage

All resources, including Science, have a maximum storage limit (cap). Reaching this limit can greatly slow progress. Science has a default maximum capacity of **250**.

The maximum Science storage (cap) can be increased by various structures and upgrades:

*   **Libraries, Academies, and Labs:**
    *   **Library:** +250 Max Science.
    *   **Academy:** +500 Max Science.
    *   **Observatory:** +1000 Max Science.
    *   **Bio Lab:** +1500 Max Science.
    *   **Data Center** (upgraded Library): +750 Max Science.
*   **Upgrades and Policies:**
    *   **LHC** (unlocked by Dimensional Physics): Grants **+2,500 Max Science per Accelerator**.
    *   **Technocracy** policy (Government tree): Increases science cap by **+20%**.
    *   **Titanium Reflectors, Unobtainium Reflectors, Eludium Reflectors:** These upgrades, linked to Observatories, increase the maximum science bonus of Libraries/Data Centers by **2% per Observatory**.
    *   **Uplink/Starlink:** These upgrades cause Data Centers and Bio Labs to provide bonuses to each other's maximum science capacity.
