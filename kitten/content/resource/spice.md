Spice is primarily used as a **rare luxury resource** and a **building component** for advanced structures in *Kittens Game* [1-3].

### Uses and Effects

1.  **Happiness Bonus (Luxury Resource)**
    Spice is categorized as a rare luxury resource [3]. Every rare resource, including spice, provides a **+10% bonus to happiness** [3].
2.  **Building Material**
    Spice is a resource required for constructing late-game religious buildings:
    *   The **Brewery** requires 5 Spice, along with Wood, Culture, and Parchment [4].
    *   The **Marker**, a strange structure made of unknown metal, costs 50,000 Spice [1].
    *   The **Black Pyramid**, a dark relic of unspeakable horrors that unlocks trade with Leviathans, costs 150,000 Spice [2].

### Characteristics and Management

*   **Consumption and Degradation:** Spice is a resource that **gradually degrades over time** [3, 5].
    *   Tradeposts help decrease the consumption rate of spice, though with diminishing returns [3].
    *   The **Stoicism** policy can be chosen to halve the consumption of luxury resources, which includes Spice, and also reduces Brewery consumption by 25% [6].
    *   Once a **Brewery** is built, it consumes 0.1 Spice per tick [4].

### Acquisition

Spice is acquired during successful trade transactions [3, 5].

*   Any successful trade performed has a chance of receiving spices [7].
*   There is a **35% chance of one Spice being included** in the trade, with a minimum amount of 25, which can be increased by your trade ratio value [7].
*   The chance of receiving spice increases by 1 percentage point per embassy built, and this increase has no diminishing returns [7, 8].
