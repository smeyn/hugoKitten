[Fur]( {{< relref "resource/Fur.md" >}}) is a rare luxury resource in *Kittens Game* that serves two primary functions: providing a **happiness boost** to your workforce and acting as the foundational material for **crafting parchment**.

### **Acquisition and Production**
There are two main methods to obtain fur:
*   **Hunting:** Once you research [Archery]( {{< relref "techs/Archery.md" >}}), you can send your kittens on hunts. Each hunt costs **100 Catpower** and is guaranteed to yield some amount of fur. The amount returned is dictated by your **Hunting Bonus**, which is increased by workshop upgrades such as [Bolas]( {{< relref "upgrade/Bolas.md" >}}), [Hunting Armour]( {{< relref "upgrade/Hunting_Armour.md" >}}), [Steel Armour]( {{< relref "upgrade/Steel_Armour.md" >}}), [Alloy Armour]( {{< relref "upgrade/Alloy_Armour.md" >}}), and [Nanosuits]( {{< relref "upgrade/Nanosuits.md" >}}).
*   [Mints:]( {{< relref "buildings/Mint.md" >}}) In the mid-game, [Mints]( {{< relref "buildings/Mint.md" >}}) (unlocked via Architecture) can be activated to automatically generate furs. The production rate of a Mint is tied to your **maximum Catpower capacity** (0.00875% of max catpower per tick). Using Mints is highly recommended during idle periods to stockpile fur without manual clicking.

### **Key Uses and Mechanics**
*   **Happiness and Efficiency:** As a "rare resource", fur provides a **+10% bonus to kitten happiness**. Because happy kittens are more productive, maintaining a supply of fur is a global production modifier. However, furs are **gradually consumed over time**, meaning you must constantly replenish them to maintain the bonus.
*   **Crafting Parchment:** Fur is the exclusive ingredient for [Parchment]( {{< relref "craft/Parchment.md" >}}) (requiring 175 fur per craft). Parchment is an essential bottleneck resource used to create [Manuscripts]( {{< relref "resource/manuscript.md" >}}), which are required for nearly all mid-game scientific advancements and religious structures like [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}).
*   **Loss on Reset:** Like all luxury resources, accumulated furs are **lost upon resetting** the game.

### **Strategic Management and Policy/**
The consumption and effectiveness of fur can be altered through various Policy/:
*   [Stoicism:]( {{< relref "Policy/Stoicism.md" >}}) Reduces the consumption rate of luxury resources like fur by **50%**.
*   **Epicureanism:** Increases the happiness bonus provided by fur from 10% to **11%**.
*   [Extravagance:]( {{< relref "Policy/Extravagance.md" >}}) Increases the happiness from consumable luxuries to 5 points but triples the consumption rate.
*   [Tradition:]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}) While it doesn't affect fur directly, it reduces the amount of parchment needed for manuscripts, thereby making your fur-to-culture conversion more efficient.

**Note:** "Fur" is also one of the possible last names randomly assigned to your kittens upon their arrival in the village.

**Analogy:**
Think of Fur as **fuel for a fire** on a cold night. While it’s burning, it provides warmth (Happiness) that makes everyone work better, but if you don't keep adding logs (Hunting or Mints), the fire will eventually go out as the wood is consumed. If you have enough wood, you can also stop using it for heat and carve it into furniture (Parchment) to build more permanent structures for your home.
