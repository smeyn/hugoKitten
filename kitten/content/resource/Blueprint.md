Blueprints are a crucial **Craftable Resource** required for technological advancement and the construction of advanced industrial buildings in *Kittens Game*.

Here is a comprehensive overview of Blueprints:

### Acquisition

Blueprints can be acquired through crafting or trade:

1.  **Crafting:**
    *   Blueprints are crafted from 25 [Compendium]( {{< relref "Compendium.md" >}}) and **25,000 Science**.
    *   The capacity to craft Blueprints is unlocked after researching the [Physics]( {{< relref "techs/Physics.md" >}}) technology.
    *   Crafting blueprints is considered to have an **"incredibly steep production cost"**, and the process is the same as crafting Manuscripts.
    *   The process often requires mass conversion: first converting Furs into Parchment, then Parchment into Manuscripts, and finally Manuscripts into Compendiums before crafting the Blueprint.
    *   The Metaphysics upgrade **Codex Agrum** reduces the cost growth ratio by adding **+25%** to your blueprint craft ratio and multiplying the blueprint craft multiplier by **x1.05**.

2.  [Trading:]( {{< relref "guides/trading.md" >}})
    *   Any successful trade with other civilizations has a **10% chance** of including one [blueprint]( {{< relref "resource/Blueprint.md" >}}) as an extra resource. This is a fixed rate that cannot be increased by other trade bonuses.
    *   Trading is often the preferred initial method, as players are advised to "keep Trading with other civilizations until you luck out and get a Blueprints for free" due to their steep production cost.
    *   Trading with [Nagas]( {{< relref "trade/Nagas.md" >}}) can specifically boost Blueprint acquisition: Building Naga embassies increases the chance to get blueprints from Nagas by **0.25%**, capping at **10%** at 40 embassies. Once the maximum bonus is achieved, embassies over 40 improve the blueprint crafting ratio instead.

### Uses and Costs

Blueprints are necessary for mid-to-late-game progression, being required for both technologies and buildings:

1.  **Buildings:**
    *   Blueprints are integral to constructing key advanced structures.
    *   The [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}) building requires **1 Blueprint**, 65 Steel, and 20 Gears.
    *   The [Magneto]( {{< relref "buildings/Magneto.md" >}}) building requires **1 Blueprint**, 10 Alloy, and 5 Gears.
    *   Other important structures like the [Calciner]( {{< relref "buildings/Calciner.md" >}}) and [Ziggurat]( {{< relref "buildings/Ziggurat.md" >}}) also require **1 Blueprint**.
    *   Mega Structures, such as the [Reactor]( {{< relref "buildings/Reactor.md" >}}), require **25 Blueprints**.
    *   The final upgrade to the Warehouse, the **Spaceport**, requires **500 Blueprints**.

2.  **Technologies (Techs):**
    *   Blueprints become required resources for researching technologies starting with [Industrialization]( {{< relref "techs/Industrialization.md" >}}) (25 Blueprints).
    *   Later, more advanced technologies require increasing quantities of Blueprints, such as [Orbital Engineering]( {{< relref "techs/Orbital_Engineering.md" >}}) (250 Blueprints), and **Exometallurgy** (350 Blueprints).

3.  **Workshop Upgrades:**
    *   Many efficiency upgrades require blueprints, especially those associated with Steamworks and automation. Examples include the [Advanced Automation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Advanced_Automation.md" >}}) (25 Blueprints) and [High Pressure Engine]( {{< relref "upgrade/High_Pressure_Engine.md" >}}) (5 Blueprints) upgrades.
    *   Upgrades for oil production, such as the [Tanker]( {{< relref "craft/Tanker.md" >}}) which increases maximum oil capacity, require **5 Blueprints**.

### Strategic Notes

*   In the Titanium era, Blueprints often become necessary for learning later sciences, and you can stock up on them by trading while also acquiring needed titanium and steel.
*   When crafting blueprints, you can make your **leader a scientist** to obtain a science discount on the crafting cost.
*   In the end-game, blueprints can become a bottleneck. Strategies for acquiring them quickly involve using Mints to generate Furs (for Parchment) or relying heavily on trade, with trade being the fastest method for resets once you have a massive Catpower stockpile.
