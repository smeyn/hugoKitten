[Unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}}) is a rare, high-tier resource that marks the transition into the late game (Phase 4). It is primarily refined from uranium and is essential for space exploration, time manipulation, and advanced engineering.

### **Production and Acquisition**
Unobtainium is generated using [Lunar Outposts]( {{< relref "planet/lunar_outpost.md" >}}) on Redmoon, which convert **1.75 uranium into 0.035 unobtainium per second**. Production can be significantly enhanced through several methods:
*   **Global Multipliers:** Productivity is boosted by [Space Elevators]( {{< relref "space/space_elevator.md" >}}) (+1%), [Orbital Arrays]( {{< relref "space/orbital_array.md" >}}) (+2%), and the **Cosmological Libertarianism policy** (+15%).
*   [Space Manufacturing:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Space_Manufacturing.md" >}}) This workshop upgrade allows **Factories** to improve the effectiveness of Space Elevators and Orbital Arrays, further scaling output.
*   **Celestial Cycles:** During the [Redmoon cycle]( {{< relref "Cycles/Redmoon_cycle.md" >}}), unobtainium output increases by **20%**. If [Numeromancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/numeromancy.md" >}}) is researched, holding a festival during this cycle provides a **2x multiplier** to unobtainium income. Conversely, the [Charon cycle]( {{< relref "Cycles/Charon_Cycle.md" >}}) imposes a **10% production penalty**.

### **Storage and Capacity**
Managing unobtainium storage is a major bottleneck in late-game progression. The base capacity is **150 units**, which must be expanded to reach milestones like the "Eludium Era".
*   **Storage Buildings:** **Moon Bases** provide **+150 capacity**, while **Cryostations** (located on Terminus) provide a much larger **+750 capacity**.
*   **Storage Enhancements:** Capacity is further boosted by [Paragon]( {{< relref "resource/paragon.md" >}}) (0.1% per point), [AI Bases]( {{< relref "upgrade/AI_Bases.md" >}}) (+10% per AI Core), **Sunforges** (+1% for base metals), **Event Horizons** (+10%), and **Void Rifts** (+2%).
*   **T-Minus Cycle:** This cycle provides a **+20% storage bonus** specifically for Cryostations.

### **Strategic Uses**
Unobtainium is a prerequisite for the most advanced technologies and upgrades in the game:
*   [Metaphysics:]( {{< relref "techs/Metaphysics.md" >}}) Unlocking the Metaphysics technology requires **5 units** of unobtainium.
*   [Eludium:]( {{< relref "resource/eludium.md" >}}) This advanced alloy is crafted using **1000 unobtainium** and 2500 alloy.
*   **Trading with Leviathans:** Once a Black Pyramid is built, you can trade **5000 units** of unobtainium to the Leviathans for [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}) and [Relics]( {{< relref "resource/relic.md" >}}).
*   **Infrastructure Upgrades:** It is required for [Unobtainium Huts]( {{< relref "upgrade/Unobtainium_Huts.md" >}}) (which reduce hut price ratios), [Unobtainium Reflectors]( {{< relref "upgrade/Unobtainium_Reflectors.md" >}}) (increasing science caps), and the construction of [Markers]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Marker.md" >}}).
*   [Chronospheres:]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}) Building a Chronosphere costs **2500 units**. These are vital for resets, as each Chronosphere preserves **1.5%** of your unobtainium for the next run.

### **The "Positive Reset" Goal**
For endgame players, the ultimate objective is to establish a **self-sustaining reset loop**. This is achieved by reaching an unobtainium capacity of at least **8.14 billion units**, allowing for the construction of **100 Chronospheres**. At this level, the resources carried over during a reset exceed the costs of the Chronospheres built, enabling exponential growth in subsequent runs.
