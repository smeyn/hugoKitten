Faith is a **special expendable resource** in *Kittens Game* that is used almost exclusively within the Religion tab.

### Unlocking and Production

Faith becomes available after you research the **Theology** science, which also unlocks the ability to build **Temples** and assign kittens to the **Priest** profession.

Faith is generated through several means:

*   **Temples:** Once Theology is researched, Temples generate **0.0015 faith per tick**.
*   **Priests:** Kittens assigned as Priests (unlocked by Theology) initially produce **0.0015 faith per tick**. In the late game, players often assign almost all kittens as priests because faith production is slow.
*   **Chapels:** These buildings, available after researching **Acoustics**, generate **0.005 faith per tick**.
*   **Upgrades:** The religious upgrade **Solar Chant** increases your faith generation rate by **10%**, with subsequent levels purchased via Transcendence increasing this bonus by an additional **+10%**.

Faith production is generally affected by the Paragon and Religion production boosts.

### Uses and Religious Progression

Faith is used to purchase religious upgrades and to convert into **Worship**.

1.  **Praising the Sun:** x You can convert accumulated Faith into **Worship** by selecting the "Praise the sun!" option. 
 [praise the sun]({{< relref "praise_the_sun.md" >}} )   
2.  **Upgrades:** Once unlocked by accumulating sufficient Worship, various religious upgrades can be purchased using Faith. These upgrades, which are part of the Order of the Sun, often affect other aspects of your civilisation:
    *   **Solar Revolution** (Worship 1000 required, costs 750 Faith and 500 Gold) grants a global production bonus based on your accumulated Worship.
    *   **Scholasticism** (Worship 300 required) allows Temples to contribute to Science.
    *   **Sun Altar** (Worship 750 required) contributes to overall Happiness.

### Storage Capacity

Faith is a capped resource. The **initial storage capacity is 100**. Your maximum Faith capacity is increased primarily through buildings and religious upgrades, as noted in our conversation history:

*   **Temples** are the main source, increasing Faith storage by **100** each.
*   The **Sun Altar** upgrade increases Temple maximum faith storage by **+50**, with an additional **+50** for each extra level purchased using Transcendence.
*   The **Golden Spire** upgrade increases Temple maximum faith storage by **50%**. This is a multiplier applied after other effects are calculated, and this percentage increases by an additional **+10%** for each additional level purchased via Transcendence.

### End-Game Importance (Apocrypha and Transcendence)

Faith is crucial for accessing the deeper mechanics of the Religion tab:

*   To access **Apocrypha** (the ability to convert Worship to Epiphany), you must reach a maximum Faith limit of **100K** and spend 5000 Faith and 5000 Gold.
*   **Apocrypha** unlocks the ability to "Adore the galaxy," which converts all accumulated Worship into **Epiphany**. Epiphany provides a bonus that makes future Praising more effective.
*   Reaching this high capacity for Apocrypha is also essential for working toward **Transcendence**, which requires a Worship cap of 125K, and costs 7500 Faith and 7500 Gold. Transcendence levels increase the conversion multiplier when Adoring the Galaxy, helping players quickly max out their Solar Revolution production bonus after a reset.
