+++

The initial storage limit for [Gold]( {{< relref "resource/Gold.md" >}}) is **10** units [1]. This capacity can be increased through the construction of specific storage buildings, as well as production buildings that feature storage benefits, such as the Mint [1, 2].

Here are the ways to increase your maximum Gold storage:

### 1. Dedicated Buildings and Upgrades

Several buildings directly contribute to your maximum Gold capacity:

*   [Mint:]( {{< relref "buildings/Mint.md" >}}) The [Mint]( {{< relref "buildings/Mint.md" >}}) building increases your **Max Gold by +100** [2]. Mints are unlocked by researching [Architecture]( {{< relref "techs/Architecture.md" >}}) [3] and are constructed using 5,000 Minerals, 200 Plate, and 500 Gold [2]. Building more Mints is suggested as a method to increase your Gold storage limit [4].
*   [Barn:]( {{< relref "buildings/Barn.md" >}}) The [Barn]( {{< relref "buildings/Barn.md" >}}), unlocked by [Agriculture]( {{< relref "techs/Agriculture.md" >}}), provides a base increase of **+10 Max Gold** [1, 5].
*   [Warehouse:]( {{< relref "buildings/Warehouse.md" >}}) The [Warehouse]( {{< relref "buildings/Warehouse.md" >}}), unlocked by [Construction]( {{< relref "techs/Construction.md" >}}), provides a base increase of **+5 Max Gold** [5].
*   [Harbour:]( {{< relref "buildings/Harbour.md" >}}) The [Harbour]( {{< relref "buildings/Harbour.md" >}}), unlocked by [Navigation]( {{< relref "techs/Navigation.md" >}}), provides a base increase of **+25 Max Gold** [5].
*   [Sky Palace:]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Sky_Palace.md" >}}) The [Sky Palace]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Sky_Palace.md" >}}), a religious building, improves gold storage by **+1%** [6].

### 2. Storage Upgrades

Various Workshop upgrades applied to storage buildings will further increase the Gold capacity of Mints, Warehouses, and Harbours:

*   [Reinforced Warehouses:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Reinforced_Warehouses.md" >}}) Increases the maximum limit for several resources, including Gold, from Warehouses, Barns, Harbors, and Mints by **+25%** [7]. This upgrade is unlocked by [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) [7, 8].
*   [Titanium Warehouses:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Titanium_Warehouses.md" >}}) Increases Gold capacity from the specified storage buildings by **+50%** [4, 7].
*   [Alloy Warehouses:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Alloy_Warehouses.md" >}}) Increases Gold capacity from the specified storage buildings by **+45%** [7].
*   [Concrete Pillars:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Concrete_Pillars.md" >}}) Increases Gold capacity from the specified storage buildings by **+5%** [7].
*   [Concrete Warehouses:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Concrete_Warehouses.md" >}}) Increases Gold capacity from the specified storage buildings by **+35%** [7].
*   [Storage Bunkers:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Storage_Bunkers.md" >}}) Increases Gold capacity from the specified storage buildings by **+20%**. This upgrade is unlocked by [Exogeology]( {{< relref "resource/exogeology.md" >}}) [7, 9].

### 3. Advanced Mechanisms

Late-game advanced production and prestige mechanics also influence Gold capacity:

*   [Paragon:]( {{< relref "resource/paragon.md" >}}) High levels of [Paragon]( {{< relref "resource/paragon.md" >}}) (gained by resetting with more than 70 kittens) improve resource caps, and this effect on storage never diminishes [10, 11].
*   **Accelerator Upgrades:** Advanced Accelerator Workshop upgrades, associated with pocket dimensions, also increase the maximum capacity of Gold:
    *   [Energy Rifts]( {{< relref "upgrade/Energy_Rifts.md" >}}) (Requires Dimensional Physics) [12].
    *   [Stasis Chambers]( {{< relref "upgrade/Stasis_Chambers.md" >}}) (Requires Chronophysics) increases max Gold from Accelerators by **+95%** [12].
    *   [Void Energy]( {{< relref "upgrade/Void_Energy.md" >}}) (Requires Stasis Chambers) increases max Gold from Accelerators by **+75%** [12].
    *   [Dark Energy]( {{< relref "upgrade/Dark_Energy.md" >}}) (Requires Void Energy) increases max Gold from Accelerators by **+250%** [12].
    *   [Tachyon Accelerators]( {{< relref "upgrade/Tachyon_Accelerators.md" >}}) (Requires Tachyon Theory) increases max Gold from Accelerators by **+500%** [12].
*   **Event Horizon:** This Cryptotheology upgrade, available at Transcendence-Tier 7, increases the global resource storage ratio by **+10%** [13].

### Strategic Importance

Increasing Gold storage is necessary because Gold is used extensively:

*   [Trading:]( {{< relref "guides/trading.md" >}}) Gold is required for trading with civilizations [14], and the [Isolationism]( {{< relref "policies/Isolationism.md" >}}) policy reduces the Gold cost per trade by 1 [15].
*   **Building:** Gold is needed to construct high-tier buildings like [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}) [16, 17], [Tradeposts]( {{< relref "buildings/Tradepost.md" >}}) [2, 18], and [Mints]( {{< relref "buildings/Mint.md" >}}) [2].
*   **Upgrades:** Gold is a component cost for several religious upgrades, such as [Golden Spire]( {{< relref "religion/Golden_Spire.md" >}}), [Sun Altar]( {{< relref "religion/Sun_Altar.md" >}}), [Stained Glass]( {{< relref "religion/Stained_Glass.md" >}}), [Solar Revolution]( {{< relref "religion/Solar_Revolution.md" >}}), [Basilica]( {{< relref "religion/Basilica.md" >}}), [Templars]( {{< relref "religion/Templars.md" >}}), **Apocrypha**, and [Transcendence]( {{< relref "religion/Transcendence.md" >}}) [19-22].

In the "Titanium era," Gold becomes a major bottleneck for trade and building Temples, emphasizing the need to maximize its accumulation and storage [23, 24].
