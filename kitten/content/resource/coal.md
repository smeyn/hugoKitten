Coal is a **Common Resource** in *Kittens Game* that is essential for progressing into the industrial phase of the game.

Here is a comprehensive overview of how Coal is produced, its strategic importance, and its consumption:

### Acquisition and Production

Coal production is unlocked after researching the [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) technology. Once unlocked, Coal can be generated in several ways:

1.  **Mines (Deep Mining Upgrade):** The [Deep Mining]( {{< relref "upgrade/Deep_Mining.md" >}}) upgrade, unlocked by [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}), allows [Mines]( {{< relref "buildings/Mine.md" >}}) to produce Coal.
    *   Mines produce Coal at a rate of **0.003 Coal per tick** (0.015 per second).
    *   This upgrade requires **5,000 Science**, **1,200 Iron**, and **50 Beam**.

2.  **Smelters (Coal Furnace Upgrade):** The [Coal Furnace]( {{< relref "upgrade/Coal_Furnace.md" >}}) upgrade, also unlocked by [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}), enables [Smelters]( {{< relref "buildings/Smelter.md" >}}) to produce Coal.
    *   Smelters produce Coal at a rate of **0.005 Coal per tick** (0.025 per second) while burning wood.
    *   This upgrade costs **5,000 Science**, **5,000 Minerals**, **2,000 Iron**, and **35 Beam**.

3.  **Geologists (Job):** The [Geologist]( {{< relref "job/Geologist.md" >}}) job, unlocked by the [Geology]( {{< relref "techs/Geology.md" >}}) technology, directly generates Coal at a rate of **0.015 per tick**.
    *   The [Mining Drill]( {{< relref "upgrade/Mining_Drill.md" >}}) upgrade further boosts Geologist Coal production by **0.01 Coal per tick** (0.05/sec).
    *   The [Unobtainium Drill]( {{< relref "upgrade/Unobtainium_Drill.md" >}}) upgrade provides an additional boost of **0.015 Coal per tick** (0.075/sec).

4.  **Quarries:** The [Quarry]( {{< relref "buildings/Quarry.md" >}}) building, unlocked by [Geology]( {{< relref "techs/Geology.md" >}}), automatically produces Coal at a rate of **0.015 Coal per tick**.

5.  **Trading (Spiders):** Coal can be acquired by trading [Scaffolds]( {{< relref "craft/Scaffold.md" >}}) with [Spiders]( {{< relref "trade/spiders.md" >}}).
    *   Spiders sell **350 Coal** per trade.
    *   Spiders are a Friendly civilization (+15% trade bonus) and are unlocked once you have **100 Trade Ships** and **125k Max Science**.
    *   Trade with Spiders for Coal is optimally performed during **Autumn** (+15% amount modifier).

6.  **Production Multipliers:** The [Pyrolysis]( {{< relref "upgrade/Pyrolysis.md" >}}) Workshop upgrade boosts general Coal output by **20%**, though this bonus does not apply to Smelters.

### Strategic Importance and Consumption

Coal is essential for crafting advanced resources and powering industrial buildings:

*   **Crafting Steel:** Coal is needed, alongside Iron, to craft [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) (100 Iron and 100 Coal). Steel is required for Gears and complex machinery.
*   **Powering Steamworks:** Coal is primarily used to power the [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}) building, which is crucial for automation.
    *   Steamworks consumes Coal. The base consumption rate is **-80%** (i.e., they consume 80% of the normal consumption value, though the precise base consumption amount is not listed in the provided sources).
    *   Upgrades like the [High Pressure Engine]( {{< relref "upgrade/High_Pressure_Engine.md" >}}) and **Fuel Injector** can reduce Steamworks' coal consumption by **20%** each.
*   **Early Game Strategy:** Once the [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) technology is researched, players are generally advised to acquire both the [Coal Furnace]( {{< relref "upgrade/Coal_Furnace.md" >}}) and [Deep Mining]( {{< relref "upgrade/Deep_Mining.md" >}}) upgrades to start accumulating Coal. However, shortly after acquiring the upgrades, players should often allow Coal to **max out**, as the Iron used to produce it is prioritized for building [Lumber Mills]( {{< relref "buildings/Lumber_Mill.md" >}}) and **Observatories**.

### Storage

The default storage limit for Coal is **60**.

*   Storage buildings like [Barns]( {{< relref "buildings/Barn.md" >}}) and [Warehouses]( {{< relref "buildings/Warehouse.md" >}}) increase the capacity for Coal.
*   The [Barges]( {{< relref "upgrade/Barges.md" >}}) upgrade increases the maximum Coal stored by [Harbours]( {{< relref "buildings/Harbour.md" >}}) by **50%**.

Coal is one of the foundational resources needed for the mid-game, as its production and utilization facilitate the shift from a basic agrarian economy to an industrial one, similar to how the early days of a growing town rely on charcoal or timber before progressing to the efficiency of larger fuel sources.
