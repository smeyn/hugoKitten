[Compendiums]( {{< relref "resource/Compendium.md" >}}) are an essential craftable resource in the mid-game of *Kittens Game*, acting as a required input for advanced technological research and increasing your maximum science storage capacity.

### Crafting and Unlocking

*   **Prerequisite:** Compendiums are enabled for crafting after researching [Philosophy]( {{< relref "science/Philosophy.md" >}}) (9,500 Science).
*   **Cost to Craft:** Creating one Compendium requires **50 Manuscripts** and **10,000 Science**.

### Strategic Importance and Usage

Compendiums serve two primary, critical functions:

1.  **Technological Advancement:** They are mandatory prerequisites for several high-cost, mid-game technologies that unlock major industrial and scientific pathways, including:
    *   [Architecture]( {{< relref "techs/Architecture.md" >}}) (Cost: 10 Compendiums)
    *   [Physics]( {{< relref "techs/Physics.md" >}}) (Cost: 35 Compendiums)
    *   [Chemistry]( {{< relref "techs/Chemistry.md" >}}) (Cost: 50 Compendiums)
    *   [Geology]( {{< relref "techs/Geology.md" >}}) (Cost: 65 Compendiums)
    *   [Electricity]( {{< relref "techs/Electricity.md" >}}) (Cost: 85 Compendiums)

2.  **Science Storage Expansion:** Each Compendium crafted provides a permanent **+10 increase to your maximum Science storage**. This bonus is crucial for overcoming the quickly escalating costs of the technology tree, although this increase is capped by default at 100% of your science storage provided by buildings.

### Progression and Efficiency

Compendiums are a necessary input for expanding scientific throughput. To efficiently craft them, you must first secure a strong cultural base to produce the precursor resource, Manuscripts.

*   **Compendium Crafting Rate:** Achieving efficient Compendium production requires maximising your [Workshops]( {{< relref "buildings/Workshop.md" >}}), as their collective effect provides a multiplicative boost to all crafting operations. For instance, if your crafting bonus is $5\times$, Compendium production would be boosted by a factor of 125 ($5 \times 5 \times 5$) compared to having no Workshops.
*   **Next Tier Resource:** Once Physics is researched, Compendiums become the resource used to craft [Blueprints]( {{< relref "resource/Blueprint.md" >}}).

### Metaphysics Upgrades (Codexes)

The importance of Compendium crafting is recognised in the permanent Metaphysics upgrade system:

*   **Codex Logos:** Costs **50 Paragon** and specifically adds **+25% to your craft ratio when crafting Compendia**. It also multiplies all Compendium crafting by $\times 1.05$.
*   **Codex Agrum:** Costs 75 Paragon and further increases the Compendium craft multiplier to $\times 1.1$.
*   **Codex Leviathanianus:** Costs 75 Paragon and increases the Compendium cut-off limit by $5\%$ per Transcendence tier.

While these Codex upgrades boost crafting efficiency, they are often considered low priority for newer players due to their high cost and small returns compared to the critical price ratio reduction upgrades.

For players executing quick runs designed to accumulate Paragon quickly, stockpiling a certain amount of Compendiums (e.g., **16.1k Compendia**) before resetting with a Chronosphere and the Flux Condensator upgrade is recommended, as this crafted resource can be carried over to accelerate the next run. This allows players to skip the time-consuming process of crafting them immediately in the new run.
