Antimatter is a resource within *Kittens Game* that can be produced primarily through a dedicated late-game structure, and its accumulation can be accelerated by manipulating time.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of how antimatter is produced and managed:

### Primary Production

The direct method for producing antimatter is through the construction of [Sunlifters]( {{< relref "space/sunlifter.md" >}}).

*   Sunlifters generate antimatter at a base rate of **1 unit per year**.
*   The Sunlifter building is unlocked after successfully completing the [Helios mission]( {{< relref "space/Helios_Mission.md" >}}).
*   Building a Sunlifter is expensive, costing 500k Science, 225 Eludium, and 2500 Kerosene.
*   Sunlifters also provide energy production (30Wt).

### Production Acceleration

Since antimatter is produced yearly, its generation can be dramatically increased by advancing the game calendar through time manipulation:

*   Antimatter is gained automatically **when the year changes**.
*   If you are waiting for more antimatter, you can use the Time tab to combust a **Time Crystal** in your **Chronofurnace**.
*   Shattering a Time Crystal allows you to **skip ahead to the start of the next spring**, which advances the calendar year and triggers the antimatter gain.
*   When using this technique to generate antimatter quickly, it is crucial to ensure that the village's overall **energy balance remains positive**.
*   It is advised to utilize [Thorium Reactors]( {{< relref "upgrade/Thorium_Reactors.md" >}}) specifically when **time skipping for antimatter**.

### Storage and Uses

Antimatter is a common resource essential for deep endgame technologies and structures.

*   Antimatter has a default initial storage capacity of **100**.
*   To hold large quantities, players must build up their Antimatter Cap using structures like **Containment Chambers** and **Heatsinks**.
*   Antimatter is a required resource for several high-level buildings:
    *   [AI Core]( {{< relref "buildings/AI_Core.md" >}}): Requires 125 Antimatter and 500k Science.
    *   [Relic Station]( {{< relref "upgrade/Relic_Station.md" >}}): Requires 5000 Antimatter and 100 Eludium. Furthermore, Relic production from the Relic Station scales based on your antimatter storage, with production reduced proportionally if storage is below 5000 units.
    *   **Terraforming Station** (on Yarn): Requires 25 Antimatter.
