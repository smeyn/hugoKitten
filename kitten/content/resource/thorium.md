[Thorium]( {{< relref "thorium.md" >}}) is a late-game resource primarily used as a highly radioactive and unstable fuel, and its function is integrated with power generation, specialized upgrades, and trading.

Here is a comprehensive overview of Thorium:

### Acquisition and Crafting

Thorium is a **Craftable Resource** [1]:
*   **Source:** It is crafted from [Uranium]( {{< relref "uranium.md" >}}) [1].
*   **Crafting Cost:** **250 Uranium** are required to craft one unit of Thorium [1].
*   **Unlocking:** The ability to craft Thorium is unlocked by researching the [Thorium]( {{< relref "thorium.md" >}}) science [1, 2].
    *   The [Thorium]( {{< relref "thorium.md" >}}) science costs **375K Science** and **375 Blueprints**, and is unlocked by [Orbital Engineering]( {{< relref "orbital_engineering.md" >}}) [2].
*   **Trade:** Thorium can also be acquired through trade with [Dragons]( {{< relref "trade/Dragons.md" >}}). Dragons sell Thorium (minimum amount 1) with a **50% chance** of success, provided you have at least Embassy Level 5 with them [3].

### Uses and Upgrades

Thorium is essential for specific Reactor upgrades and advanced space travel:

*   **Thorium Reactors (Upgrade):** This Workshop upgrade increases Reactor energy output by **$0.25$ Wt** (+25%) [4, 5]. However, this upgrade also causes the Reactor to consume Thorium at a rate of **$0.25$ per tick** per reactor [4].
    *   The upgrade costs **400K Science** and **10K Thorium** [4].
    *   The [Enriched Thorium]( {{< relref "enriched_thorium.md" >}}) upgrade further reduces this consumption by $0.0625$ per tick [4].
    *   It is generally advised in specialized runs (like the IW 40K endless run) to **turn off Thorium Reactors** when purchased and only use the upgrade when **time skipping for antimatter** [6].
*   **Thorium Drive (Upgrade):** This Workshop upgrade, which costs **400K Science**, along with Ships, Gears, Alloy, and **100K Thorium**, enhances space travel speed by setting the multiplier to **50** (travel time is divided by 50) [7].
*   **Quantum Dot Cells (Upgrade):** This upgrade, requiring [Thorium]( {{< relref "thorium.md" >}}) and other resources, improves Solar Farm energy production by **+15% in winter** and **+30% in spring and autumn** [8].

### Strategic Context

Thorium plays a role in late-game resource management, particularly in the process of building up **Antimatter Cap** [9]:
*   A major goal in the end-game is to obtain **5,000 Antimatter capacity** for [Relic Stations]( {{< relref "upgrade/Relic_Station.md" >}}) [9, 10]. Achieving this may require building Containment Chambers and Heatsinks, which heavily utilize Thorium [9].
*   For instance, obtaining the 5,000 Antimatter cap often requires approximately **34 Heatsinks** (costing **526K Thorium**) [9].

***
Thorium's relationship with Uranium is similar to how early resources are refined: just as **Wood** is refined from Catnip [11], [Thorium]( {{< relref "thorium.md" >}}) is a refined fuel source derived from Uranium, enabling higher-tier energy production and propulsion mechanisms in the late game. However, its use in [Thorium Reactors]( {{< relref "thorium_reactors.md" >}}) presents a classic trade-off: increased power output in exchange for continuous consumption of a rare, specialized resource.
