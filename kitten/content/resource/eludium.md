[Eludium]( {{< relref "eludium.md" >}}) is a highly valuable, late-game **craftable resource** in *Kittens Game*. Its primary purpose is to enable the construction of the game's final tier of housing buildings and to unlock powerful technological upgrades.

### Characteristics and Acquisition

1.  **Crafting:** Eludium is a composite alloy created by combining two other advanced resources [1]:
    *   **2,500 Alloy** [2]
    *   **1,000 Unobtainium** [2]
    *   The crafting ability is unlocked by researching the **Exometallurgy** science (formerly Advanced Exogeology) [1, 3].

2.  **Prerequisites for Crafting:**
    *   **Exometallurgy Science:** Costs 325K Science and 350 Blueprints [3]. This technology is unlocked after researching [Exogeology]( {{< relref "exogeology.md" >}}) [3].
    *   **Unobtainium Storage:** Achieving Eludium status requires substantial Unobtainium storage (1,000 Unobtainium) which means building multiple **Moon Bases** or a **Cryostation** [4].

### Primary Uses

Eludium is required for constructing the highest tier of housing and for high-level upgrades:

*   **Eludium Huts (Housing):** The [Eludium Huts]( {{< relref "eludium_huts.md" >}}) upgrade reduces the price ratio of Huts by **10%** [5, 6]. To purchase this upgrade, you need **275K Science** and **125 Eludium** [3, 6].
*   **Workshop Upgrades:** Eludium is necessary for numerous advanced Workshop upgrades, often enhancing high-tier buildings:
    *   [Dark Energy:]( {{< relref "dark_energy.md" >}}) Increases Max Catnip, Wood, Minerals, Coal, Iron, Titanium, and Gold storage from Accelerators by **+250%** [6].
    *   [Tachyon Accelerators:]( {{< relref "tachyon_accelerators.md" >}}) Increases the same Accelerator storage capacities by **+500%** [6].
    *   **Tachyon Drive:** A rocket engine that sets space travel speed to **50** (or 75 combined with Antimatter Drive) [7].
    *   [Cryocomputing:]( {{< relref "cryocomputing.md" >}}) Reduces Data Center energy consumption from 2Wt to **1Wt** [8].
    *   [Quantum Dot Cells:]( {{< relref "quantum_dot_cells.md" >}}) Improves Solar Farm energy production by **+15% in winter** and **+30% in spring and autumn** [6].
    *   **Antimatter Fission/Reactors/Drive:** Required for various Antimatter-related upgrades [8, 9].
    *   [Chronoengineers:]( {{< relref "chronoengineers.md" >}}) Improves Engineer effectiveness and allows them to work during time skips [7].
*   **Space Structures:** Eludium is used in the construction of the **Spaceport** [10].
*   [Cryptotheology:]( {{< relref "cryptotheology.md" >}}) Eludium is a cost component for advanced Cryptotheology buildings such as the [Relic Station]( {{< relref "relic_station.md" >}}) [8].

### Strategic Context

The process of acquiring Eludium defines a major phase of the game progression, known as the **Eludium Era** [4].

*   This era requires increasing the Unobtainium Production Rate to a reasonable level, primarily through [Planet Crackers]( {{< relref "space/planet_cracker.md" >}}) (to generate Uranium) and [Lunar Outposts]( {{< relref "planet/lunar_outpost.md" >}}) (to convert Uranium to Unobtainium) [11].
*   Achieving Eludium Huts is considered the next major checkpoint after [Concrete Huts]( {{< relref "concrete_huts.md" >}}) [12, 13]. Once Eludium Huts are built, the player is considered ready for the subsequent **Unicorn/Time Crystal Era**, provided the Unobtainium generation rate is high enough (around 1 Unobtainium per second or 1,100 Paragon plus the Renaissance upgrade) [14].

**Analogy:** If Alloy is the steel frame of a skyscraper, and Unobtainium is the unique, high-strength glass that allows it to reach impossible heights, then [Eludium]( {{< relref "eludium.md" >}}) is the final, specialized rivet that binds them together, enabling construction of structures (like Eludium Huts) that define the architectural apex of the kitten civilization.
