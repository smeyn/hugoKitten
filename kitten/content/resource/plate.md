Plate is a core mid-game resource in *Kittens Game* that is produced entirely through **crafting** using Iron as the primary input.

Here is a detailed breakdown of plate production, the required input, and mechanisms for acquisition:

### 1. Primary Production: Crafting

Plate (specifically [Metal Plate]( {{< relref "craft/Metal_Plate.md" >}})) is categorized as a craftable resource.

*   **Input Cost:** One Metal Plate is crafted in the Workshop by consuming **125 Iron**.
*   **Purpose:** Plate is required for advanced construction in the early and mid-game, particularly for buildings like [Harbours]( {{< relref "buildings/Harbour.md" >}}).

### 2. Supporting Iron Production (The Prerequisite)

Since Plate production is capped by your Iron supply, effective production requires robust Iron generation, which is achieved through refining and trade:

*   [Smelters:]( {{< relref "buildings/Smelter.md" >}}) Iron is refined from wood and minerals using [Smelters]( {{< relref "buildings/Smelter.md" >}}). Smelters unlock after researching [Metal Working]( {{< relref "techs/Metal_Working.md" >}}).
*   [Calciners:]( {{< relref "buildings/Calciner.md" >}}) Iron can also be refined using [Calciners]( {{< relref "buildings/Calciner.md" >}}) from oil and minerals.
*   **Upgrades:** Several Workshop upgrades boost Iron production from these buildings:
    *   [Electrolytic Smelting]( {{< relref "upgrade/Electrolytic_Smelting.md" >}}) increases Smelter output of iron (and coal) by +95%.
    *   [Fluidized Reactors]( {{< relref "upgrade/Fluidized_Reactors.md" >}}) boost Calciner output by +100% more iron.
    *   [Oxidation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Oxidation.md" >}}) increases Calciner iron production by +95%.
    *   The [Rotary Kiln]( {{< relref "upgrade/Rotary_Kiln.md" >}}) also provides a +75% increase to Calciner iron output.
*   **Policies:** The [Communism]( {{< relref "policies/Communism.md" >}}) policy grants a +25% increase to iron production. The [Rationality]( {{< relref "policies/Rationality.md" >}}) policy grants a +5% iron production bonus.
*   **Trade:** Iron can be acquired directly by trading with other races. For example, [Griffins]( {{< relref "trade/Griffins.md" >}}) sell Iron for Wood, and [Zebras]( {{< relref "trade/zebras.md" >}}) sell Iron for Slab.

### 3. Automated Conversion and Trade Acquisition

*   **Automation:** The [Pneumatic Press]( {{< relref "upgrade/Pneumatic_Press.md" >}}) Workshop upgrade, unlocked via Physics, allows [Workshop Automation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Workshop_Automation.md" >}}) to automatically convert iron to plates when iron resources are near their capacity limit.
*   **Trade Acquisition:** Plate can be acquired through trade with [Zebras]( {{< relref "trade/zebras.md" >}}). Zebras sell Plate (2 units per trade, with a 65% chance) in exchange for 50 Slab. Building **Embassies** increases the chance of receiving plates from Zebras, reaching **100% chance at Embassy level 54**.

### 4. Uses of Plate

Plate is crucial for further expanding infrastructure and developing advanced resources:

*   **Storage:** Plate is needed to build a [Harbour]( {{< relref "buildings/Harbour.md" >}}) (75 Plate), a storage building essential for increasing capacity for Catnip, Wood, Minerals, and Iron, among others.
*   **Culture/Gold:** Plate is required for [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}) (15 Plate) and [Mints]( {{< relref "buildings/Mint.md" >}}) (200 Plate). Mints increase gold storage and produce rare resources.
*   **High-Tier Structures:** Significant amounts of Plate are needed for Reactors (**5000 Plate**) and Factories (**2500 Plate**).
*   **Late-Game Crafting:** Plate is an input for crafting [Megaliths]( {{< relref "craft/Megalith.md" >}}) (5 Plate).

Plate serves as an early example of vertical production integration in the game, where continuous management of raw resources (Wood, Minerals) is required to ensure a steady supply of an intermediary resource (Iron) which is then crafted into Plate for infrastructure expansion.
