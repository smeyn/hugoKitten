[Uranium]( {{< relref "uranium.md" >}}) is a critical, late-game resource primarily used for nuclear power, advanced material refinement, and storage enhancement in *Kittens Game* [1].

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of its acquisition, storage, and uses:

### Acquisition and Production

Uranium is an **uncommon resource** that can be acquired through three main methods, with one being an advanced crafting method and the others relying on trade and late-game buildings:

1.  **Trade (Primary Source):** Uranium can be **bought from the Dragons** in exchange for [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) [1, 2]. Dragons will sell 1 Uranium with a 95% chance of success [2]. The required technology to unlock the Dragons is [Nuclear Fission]( {{< relref "nuclear_fission.md" >}}) [3, 4].
2.  **Refinement:** Uranium can be refined from [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) using the [Accelerator]( {{< relref "accelerator.md" >}}) building [1].
    *   One Accelerator produces **$0.0025$ Uranium per tick** (or $0.0125$ per second) but consumes $0.015$ Titanium per tick [5, 6].
    *   In comparison, a Lunar Outpost consumes Uranium 140 times faster than a single Accelerator produces it, highlighting the importance of multiple accelerators or trade [6, 7].
3.  **Quarry Upgrade:** After researching [Orbital Geodesy]( {{< relref "orbital_geodesy.md" >}}) (unlocked by [Satellites]( {{< relref "satellites.md" >}}) technology), **Quarries** will produce a small amount of Uranium at a rate of **$0.0005$ per tick** [5, 8]. This rate is boosted by the [Enriched Uranium]( {{< relref "enriched_uranium.md" >}}) workshop upgrade (+25%) [5, 9].
4.  **Space Production:** Uranium is produced by **Planet Crackers** [1, 10]. Production from Planet Crackers is affected by the **Dune cycle** (-10% effect without Numerology, +10% effect with Numerology) [11].

### Uses and Upgrades

Uranium is essential for progressing into the space and atomic eras of the game:

*   **Refining Unobtainium:** Uranium is refined into **Unobtainium** by a [Lunar Outpost]( {{< relref "lunar_outpost.md" >}}) [1, 6]. This is a critical step for unlocking [Metaphysics]( {{< relref "metaphysics.md" >}}) [6, 12].
*   **Fueling Reactors:** Uranium is consumed by the [Reactor]( {{< relref "reactor.md" >}}) building at a rate of **$0.001$ per tick** to generate energy [13]. The [Enriched Uranium]( {{< relref "enriched_uranium.md" >}}) upgrade reduces this consumption by 25% [9, 13].
*   **Refining Thorium:** Uranium is used to craft [Thorium]( {{< relref "thorium.md" >}}) at a rate of **250 Uranium** per unit of Thorium [14]. This is unlocked by the [Thorium]( {{< relref "thorium.md" >}}) science [15].
*   **Advanced Buildings:** Uranium is a cost component for several advanced buildings, including the [Accelerator]( {{< relref "accelerator.md" >}}) (25 Uranium) [5] and the [Reactor]( {{< relref "reactor.md" >}}) (25 Blueprints, 50 Concrete, 5,000 Plate, and 3,500 Titanium) [13].
*   **Workshop Upgrades:** Uranium is required for several high-tier upgrades, such as:
    *   [Energy Rifts]( {{< relref "energy_rifts.md" >}}) (from Accelerators) [16].
    *   [Stasis Chambers]( {{< relref "stasis_chambers.md" >}}) [16].
    *   [Void Energy]( {{< relref "void_energy.md" >}}) [16].
    *   [Nuclear Plants]( {{< relref "nuclear_plants.md" >}}) [8].
    *   [Augmentations]( {{< relref "augmentations.md" >}}) [9].

### Storage Capacity

The default maximum storage capacity for Uranium is **250** [17].

*   This capacity is mainly increased by building [Reactors]( {{< relref "buildings/Reactor.md" >}}), as each Reactor increases the maximum Uranium storage by **+250** [13].
*   The [Accelerator]( {{< relref "accelerator.md" >}}) building is also a key component for storage upgrades, as Accelerators, with the [Energy Rifts]( {{< relref "energy_rifts.md" >}}) upgrade, provide substantial storage capacity for common resources, including Uranium [16].

***
Uranium represents a bottleneck resource in the mid-to-late game [18]. Its acquisition and refinement pathway is critical because **Unobtainium**, the resource it creates, is necessary to unlock the powerful and permanent upgrades found in the [Metaphysics]( {{< relref "metaphysics.md" >}}) system [6, 19].

## What Produces Uranium
Uranium, a critical resource in the later stages of the game, is primarily acquired through three methods: trading with the Dragons, production via upgraded Quarries, and refinement using Accelerators.

Here is a breakdown of what produces or provides Uranium:

### 1. Production via Buildings and Upgrades

Uranium can be produced directly using advanced buildings and upgrades:

*   **Quarry (with Orbital Geodesy):** Quarries will provide a small amount of uranium once the [Orbital Geodesy]( {{< relref "orbital_geodesy.md" >}}) upgrade is purchased [1, 2]. Quarries produce uranium at a rate of **0.0005 per tick** [2].
    *   [Orbital Geodesy]( {{< relref "orbital_geodesy.md" >}}) requires [Satellites]( {{< relref "satellites.md" >}}) technology and costs 150,000 Science, 1,000 Alloy, and 35,000 Oil [2].
*   [Accelerator:]( {{< relref "accelerator.md" >}}) This building refines **titanium into uranium** [1]. Accelerators produce **0.0025 uranium per tick** (or 0.0125 per second) [3, 4].
    *   The Accelerator building is unlocked by researching the [Particle Physics]( {{< relref "particle_physics.md" >}}) science [3, 5]. It costs 7,500 Titanium, 125 Concrete, and 25 Uranium [3].
*   **Planet Cracker:** Uranium is produced by the **Planet Cracker** structure [1, 6]. This structure's output is affected by the [Dune]( {{< relref "dune.md" >}}) cycle, which can increase its uranium output by **+10%** [7].
*   **Reactor (Consumption Reduction):** While Reactors consume Uranium [8], the [Enriched Uranium]( {{< relref "enriched_uranium.md" >}}) upgrade reduces this consumption by **25%** and also provides a **+25% uranium production bonus** that applies only to Quarries [9].

### 2. Acquisition via Trade

The most straightforward way to initially acquire Uranium is through trade:

*   [Dragons:]( {{< relref "trade/Dragons.md" >}}) Uranium can be **bought** from the [Dragons]( {{< relref "trade/Dragons.md" >}}) civilization, in exchange for Titanium [1].
    *   Dragons sell **1 Uranium** and the trade has a 95% chance of success (reaching 100% chance with 6 Embassy levels) [10, 11].
    *   Dragons are unlocked after researching [Nuclear Fission]( {{< relref "nuclear_fission.md" >}}) [12].

### 3. Production Boosts

Uranium production can be boosted by:

*   **Cycles (Dune):** The [Dune]( {{< relref "dune.md" >}}) cycle doubles Uranium income when the **Numerology** metaphysics upgrade is researched [7].
*   [Enriched Uranium:]( {{< relref "enriched_uranium.md" >}}) This Workshop upgrade increases Uranium production by **+25%** (but only applies to Quarries) [9].
*   [Planet Busters:]( {{< relref "planet_busters.md" >}}) This upgrade doubles the output of the Planet Cracker structure [13].

Uranium is an important resource, particularly in the later stages of the game, as it is needed to refine **Unobtainium** via a Lunar Outpost [1, 4].
