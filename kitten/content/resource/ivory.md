[Ivory]( {{< relref "resource/ivory.md" >}}) is a rare luxury resource in *Kittens Game* that is primarily used to increase colony [happiness]( {{< relref "guides/Happiness.md" >}}) and facilitate progression through the religious "Unicorn Era". Unlike standard building materials, ivory is a consumable resource; as long as you have it in your inventory, it provides a **+10% happiness bonus** to your kittens, which in turn boosts their overall production efficiency.

### **How to Obtain Ivory**
There are three primary ways to accumulate ivory throughout the different phases of the game:

*   **Hunting:** Once you research [Archery]( {{< relref "techs/Archery.md" >}}), you can send kittens to hunt using 100 catpower. Each hunt has a $(44 + 2 \times \text{hunting bonus})\%$ chance to yield ivory. Researching workshop upgrades like **Bolas, Hunting Armour, and Nanosuits** increases the amount of ivory retrieved per hunt.
*   [Mints:]( {{< relref "buildings/Mint.md" >}}) These industrial buildings provide a way to **automate** ivory production. When active, a Mint consumes catpower and gold to produce ivory at a rate of **0.0021% of your maximum catpower** per tick.
*   **Ivory Meteors:** In the late game, building [Ivory Citadels]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Ivory_Citadel.md" >}}) enables a random astronomical event called an "Ivory Meteor". These events have a 0.05% chance of occurring per game-day for each citadel and provide a bulk amount of ivory. This is considered an excellent "AFK" source of the resource.

### **Strategic Uses**
Ivory is essential for both trade and advanced religious development:

*   **The Unicorn Era:** Ivory is a core requirement for almost all advanced unicorn-related buildings in the Religion tab. This includes [Ivory Towers]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Ivory_Tower.md" >}}) (25k), [Sky Palaces]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Sky_Palace.md" >}}) (125k), and [Sunspires]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Sunspire.md" >}}) (750k), which are necessary to summon alicorns and generate [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}).
*   **Trading with Nagas:** The Nagas are a neutral trade partner that **buys ivory** in exchange for minerals, slabs, and concrete. This trade is a critical mechanism for bypassing mineral bottlenecks, especially in **Iron Will mode**.
*   **Happiness Buffs:** Since ivory is a rare resource, its presence directly influences kitten morale. This effect can be enhanced by the **Epicureanism policy**, which increases the happiness bonus to 11%.

### **Management and Policy/**
Because ivory **degrades over time** and is consumed by your kittens, managing its supply is important to maintain production bonuses.

*   [Stoicism:]( {{< relref "Policy/Stoicism.md" >}}) This policy halves the consumption rate of ivory, helping your hoard last longer.
*   [Frugality:]( {{< relref "Policy/Frugality.md" >}}) This policy increases the resource output of your [Mints]( {{< relref "buildings/Mint.md" >}}) by 10%.
*   **Religious Boosts:** Buildings like **Sky Palaces, Unicorn Utopias, and Sunspires** provide percentage-based increases to the amount of ivory you gain from Ivory Meteors.

Are you currently focusing on building up your Ziggurats for the Unicorn Era, or are you looking for ivory mainly to trade for minerals?
