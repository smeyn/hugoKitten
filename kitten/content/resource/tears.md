[Tears]( {{< relref "resource/tears.md" >}}) are a critical resource associated with the Unicorn progression pathway, categorizing as a **Unique Resource** and a **Luxury Resource** in *Kittens Game* [1, 2]. They are essential inputs for escalating the religious infrastructure and advancing toward the mid-to-late-game economy, particularly by leading to the highly valuable **Black Liquid Sorrow** (BLS) [3-5].

### Acquisition and Persistence

Tears are acquired exclusively through a specific religious action:

*   **Production via Sacrifice:** Tears are gained by **sacrificing unicorns** [1, 6].
*   **Scaling with Ziggurats:** Each time unicorns are sacrificed (an action costing 2500 unicorns) [6, 7], the amount of tears received is equal to the total number of [Ziggurats]( {{< relref "buildings/Ziggurat.md" >}}) the player has built [6, 7]. Therefore, players are advised to construct a minimum of 10, or preferably 25–30, Ziggurats before converting unicorns to maximize the efficiency of Tear generation [7, 8].
*   **Loss on Reset:** As a luxury resource, **Tears are lost upon game reset**, alongside Furs, Ivory, Spice, Unicorns, Alicorns, and Necrocorns [1, 2].

### Uses and Strategic Importance

Tears are consumed for two primary purposes: investing in powerful religious infrastructure and producing the required resources for the endgame:

1.  **Building Unicorn Structures:** Tears are necessary for constructing increasingly potent religious buildings that scale unicorn production and further the resource chain:
    *   [Unicorn Tomb:]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Unicorn_Tomb.md" >}}) Costs **5 Tears** and 500 Ivory [9].
    *   [Ivory Tower:]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Ivory_Tower.md" >}}) Costs **25 Tears** and 25,000 Ivory [10].
    *   [Ivory Citadel:]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Ivory_Citadel.md" >}}) Costs **50 Tears** and 50,000 Ivory [11].
    *   [Sky Palace:]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Sky_Palace.md" >}}) Costs **500 Tears**, 125,000 Ivory, and 5 Megalith [11].
    *   [Unicorn Utopia:]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Unicorn_Utopia.md" >}}) Costs **5,000 Tears** and 1,000,000 Ivory [12].
    *   [Marker:]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Marker.md" >}}) Costs **5,000 Tears** (along with Megalith, Spice, and Unobtainium) [13].

2.  **Refinement to Black Liquid Sorrow (BLS):** Tears are refined to create **Sorrow**, also known as Black Liquid Sorrow (BLS) [4, 5]. This conversion costs **10,000 Tears per 1 Sorrow** [4]. BLS is a prerequisite for constructing [Black Pyramids]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Black_Pyramid.md" >}}) [4, 14], which are necessary to unlock the ability to **trade with the Leviathans** for advanced resources like Time Crystals and Relics [3, 14, 15].

This resource forms a critical loop in the game's late progression: Unicorns $\to$ [Tears]( {{< relref "resource/tears.md" >}}) $\to$ BLS $\to$ Black Pyramids, which then allows access to Time Crystals and Relics for temporal progression [3, 4].
