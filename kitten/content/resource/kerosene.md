Kerosene is a craftable resource essential for advanced space-related construction in *Kittens Game* [1, 2].

Here is a breakdown of Kerosene based on the provided sources:

**Nature and Acquisition**

*   Kerosene is defined as a **rocket fuel processed from oil** [1, 2].
*   It is classified as a Craftable Resource [1].
*   The technology required to enable Kerosene crafting is **Oil Processing** [2, 3].
*   To craft Kerosene in the Workshop, 7500 units of **Oil** are required [2].

**Uses in Buildings**

Kerosene is a resource needed to construct late-game space structures:

1.  **Spaceport:** Kerosene is required to build a Spaceport, which costs **1000 Kerosene** (along with 10k Titanium, 500 Eludium, 500 Blueprint, and 400k Starchart) [4]. The Spaceport is an upgrade to the Warehouse and requires the Exometallurgy prerequisite [4].
2.  **Research Vessels:** Kerosene is also required for Research Vessels [5]. The Research Vessels, which are part of the process to increase Starchart production, require **500 Kerosene** [6].
3.  In general, players will need a bunch of oil and/or Kerosene to build these advanced structures [5].

**Production and Efficiency**

*   **Upgrades:** The Workshop upgrade **Factory Processing** gives a **+5% bonus to Kerosene Crafting** [7]. This upgrade requires the Oil Processing science [8].
*   **Automation:** If your oil supply is frequently maxed out, using **Engineers** to automatically convert oil into Kerosene is a strategy to optimize production, as it prevents resources from capping out overnight [6]. Engineers are a job unlocked by the Mechanization science and can automate crafting [9].

> Kerosene acts like a high-octane blend derived from standard Oil, signifying a technological leap necessary for fueling truly expansive operations, such as launching space efforts (Spaceports) and conducting deep space research (Research Vessels).
