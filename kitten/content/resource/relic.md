[Relics]( {{< relref "resource/relic.md" >}}) are an **uncommon resource** used exclusively in the late and end phases of *Kittens Game*. They are central to unlocking the highest tiers of religious upgrades and advancing the time manipulation and antimatter systems.

The phase of the game focused on acquiring relics is often referred to as the **Mid Game** [1, 2].

Here is a detailed breakdown of how Relics are acquired and what they are used for:

### Acquisition

Relics are not produced by buildings or jobs but must be acquired through late-game conversion, trade, or specialized structures:

1.  **Refining Time Crystals (Crafting):** You can refine 25 [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}) to receive **1 Relic** [3]. This action requires having at least 25 Time Crystals [3].
2.  **Trade (Leviathans):** Relics can be bought from the [Leviathans]( {{< relref "trade/Leviathans.md" >}}) [4]. Leviathans buy 5,000 Unobtainium and sell 1 Relic with a $5\%$ chance of success [5]. Leviathans are unlocked after building a [Black Pyramid]( {{< relref "black_pyramid.md" >}}) [6].
3.  **Relic Station (Production):** The [Relic Station]( {{< relref "relic_station.md" >}}) building (unlocked by the Cryptotheology science and purchased with 5,000 Antimatter and 100 Eludium) generates **$0.01$ relic per day** [7, 8]. Relic production from the Relic Station scales based on Antimatter storage, meaning production is reduced proportionally if maximum Antimatter storage is less than 5,000 [7, 9].
4.  **Black Nexus Boost:** The production from Space Beacons upgraded with Relic Station is improved by the [Black Nexus]( {{< relref "black_nexus.md" >}}) Cryptotheology upgrade, which produces $0.01 \times (1 + (\text{Black Pyramid} \times \text{Black Nexus}/10))$ relics per day [10].

### Primary Uses and Upgrades

Relics are the required resource for purchasing most buildings and upgrades within the [Cryptotheology]( {{< relref "cryptotheology.md" >}}) system, which unlocks advanced mechanics and bonuses [11]:

*   **Technology Advancement:** Relics are necessary for key high-tier sciences:
    *   [Tachyon Theory:]( {{< relref "tachyon_theory.md" >}}) Costs $\mathbf{1\ Relic}$ and 750K Science [12].
    *   [Cryptotheology:]( {{< relref "cryptotheology.md" >}}) Costs $\mathbf{5\ Relics}$ and 650K Science [13].
    *   [Antimatter:]( {{< relref "antimatter.md" >}}) Costs $\mathbf{1\ Relic}$ and 500K Science [14].
    *   [Terraformation:]( {{< relref "terraformation.md" >}}) Costs $\mathbf{5\ Relics}$ and 750K Science [14].
    *   [Quantum Cryptography:]( {{< relref "quantum_cryptography.md" >}}) Costs $\mathbf{1024\ Relics}$ and 1.25M Science [15].
*   **Cryptotheology Buildings:** Relics are spent to purchase permanent prestige buildings:
    *   [Black Obelisk:]( {{< relref "black_obelisk.md" >}}) Costs 100 Relics [10].
    *   [Black Nexus:]( {{< relref "black_nexus.md" >}}) Costs 5,000 Relics [10].
    *   [Blazar:]( {{< relref "blazar.md" >}}) Costs $\mathbf{50,000\ Relics}$ and is required to reach **Transcendence Tier 15** [16, 17].
    *   **Event Horizon:** Costs 25,000 Relics and increases global resource storage ratio by 10% [18].
    *   [Holy Genocide:]( {{< relref "holy_genocide.md" >}}) Costs 100,000 Relics and unlocks the Post Apocalypse challenge [16].
*   [Chronoforge:]( {{< relref "chronoforge.md" >}}) Relics are a cost component for the [Chronoforge]( {{< relref "chronoforge.md" >}}) upgrade (5 Relics) [19], which is necessary for time manipulation features and the Shatter Engine [20].
*   **Pacts:** **Pacts** are purchased for $\mathbf{100\ Relics}$ each [21, 22].

### Strategic Role (Relic Engines)

Obtaining Relics is the primary focus of the mid-game [1]. Players develop specialized strategies, or "engines," to increase relic flow:

1.  **Type 0 Engine (Leviathan Trade):** Relies on trading 5,000 Unobtainium to Leviathans for relics [5, 23]. This can be optimized by using the [Chronoforge]( {{< relref "chronoforge.md" >}}) to skip non-Redmoon cycles (which boost Unobtainium production) [23, 24].
2.  **Type 1 Engine (Relic Stations):** Involves mass-producing **Space Beacons** and the [Relic Station]( {{< relref "relic_station.md" >}}) upgrade, enhancing production with [Black Nexus]( {{< relref "black_nexus.md" >}}) and [AI Cores]( {{< relref "buildings/AI_Core.md" >}}) [8].
3.  **Type 2 Engine (Shatter Engine):** Requires investing vast amounts of Time Crystals into **Resource Retrieval** to reach a point where shattering a single Time Crystal yields enough Unobtainium to immediately trade with Leviathans for multiple new Time Crystals, allowing for rapid Time Crystal refinement into Relics [9, 20, 25].

Relics are the final currency gate before the ultimate goal of maximizing Antimatter and Void resources to prepare for the End Game push for **Infinity** [1, 26].
