Increasing [coal production]( {{< relref "coal_production.md" >}}) in *Kittens Game* involves advancing your technology to unlock specialized buildings, employing Geologists, and utilizing late-game upgrades and policies.

Here are the primary methods for boosting coal production, drawing upon the available sources:

### 1. Utilizing Buildings and Upgrades

Coal is generated directly by specialized buildings and indirectly by upgrading existing industrial structures:

| Building/Upgrade | Technology Requirement | Effect on Coal Production | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Quarry]( {{< relref "quarry.md" >}}) | [Geology]( {{< relref "geology.md" >}}) [1, 2] | Base production of **+0.015 Coal per Tick** [1]. | Quarries are listed as a source of coal [3]. |
| [Deep Mining]( {{< relref "deep_mining.md" >}}) | [Steel]( {{< relref "techs/Steel.md" >}}) [4] | [Mines]( {{< relref "buildings/Mine.md" >}}) produce an additional **+0.003 Coal per Tick** [5]. | Deep Mining is a workshop upgrade that allows Mines to produce coal [5]. |
| [Coal Furnace]( {{< relref "coal_furnace.md" >}}) | [Steel]( {{< relref "techs/Steel.md" >}}) [4] | [Smelters]( {{< relref "buildings/Smelter.md" >}}) produce an additional **+0.005 Coal per Tick** [5]. | Coal Furnace is a workshop upgrade that enables Smelters to produce coal [3, 5]. |
| [Electrolytic Smelting]( {{< relref "electrolytic_smelting.md" >}}) | [Metallurgy]( {{< relref "metallurgy.md" >}}) [6] | [Smelters]( {{< relref "buildings/Smelter.md" >}}) produce **+95% more iron and coal** [7]. | This workshop upgrade significantly boosts Smelter output [7]. |
| [Pyrolysis]( {{< relref "pyrolysis.md" >}}) | [Physics]( {{< relref "physics.md" >}}) [8] | Boosts Coal production by **+20%** (multiplies with other effects) [7]. | This workshop upgrade does **not** affect Smelters [7]. |

### 2. The Geologist Job

The [Geologist]( {{< relref "geologist.md" >}}) job is a dedicated profession for coal production and can be significantly enhanced by high-tier technology:

*   **Unlocking:** The job is unlocked by researching [Geology]( {{< relref "geology.md" >}}) [2, 9].
*   **Base Production:** Geologists initially produce **+0.015 Coal per Tick** [9].
*   [Geodesy:]( {{< relref "geodesy.md" >}}) Researching the [Geodesy]( {{< relref "geodesy.md" >}}) workshop upgrade (unlocked by Geology and costing Titanium and Starcharts [2, 5]) improves Geologist output by an additional **+0.0075 coal/tick** [5]. Once Geodesy is active, Geologists also gain the ability to find gold [5].
*   [Mining Drill:]( {{< relref "mining_drill.md" >}}) This workshop upgrade (unlocked by Metallurgy) makes Geologists more effective, providing **+0.01 coal/tick** (if Geodesy is researched) [5]. Acquiring this upgrade is often recommended in the late-game for the coal grind needed for Oil Wells [10].
*   [Unobtainium Drill:]( {{< relref "unobtainium_drill.md" >}}) This high-tier upgrade (unlocked by [Exogeology]( {{< relref "exogeology.md" >}})) further increases Geologist effectiveness by **+0.015 coal/tick** (if Geodesy is researched) [5].

In the late game, once [Geodesy]( {{< relref "geodesy.md" >}}) is researched, your kittens working as Geologists become the main source of coal, iron, and titanium (via trades) [11].

### 3. Policies and Cycles (Multipliers)

Specific late-game policies and timing mechanisms can provide percentage bonuses to coal income:

*   **Communism Policy:** Choosing the [Communism]( {{< relref "communism.md" >}}) policy (unlocked by building a Factory and having Autocracy or Republic [12]) grants a **+25% iron, coal, and titanium production** bonus [12].
*   **Umbra Cycle Festival:** If you have researched **Numeromancy**, holding a festival during the **Umbra cycle** (which lasts 5 years) multiplies **coal, iron, titanium, and gold income by 1.5** [13].

### 4. External Acquisition

If production is insufficient, you can acquire coal through trade:

*   [Spiders:]( {{< relref "trade/spiders.md" >}}) Coal is a **common resource** that can be **bought from the Spiders** in exchange for [Scaffold]( {{< relref "scaffold.md" >}}) [3, 14].
*   **Seasonal Trade:** Coal trading with Spiders is most favorable during the **Autumn** season, which provides a **+15% Amount Modifier** [15].
*   **Storage:** Coal, like many basic resources, has a default maximum storage capacity, which starts at **60** [16]. This can be increased by storage buildings like [Barns]( {{< relref "buildings/Barn.md" >}}) and [Warehouses]( {{< relref "buildings/Warehouse.md" >}}) [17]. The [Barges]( {{< relref "barges.md" >}}) upgrade for Harbors specifically increases coal storage by **50%** (multiplies with other effects) [18].
