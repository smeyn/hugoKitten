Increasing **coal production** in *Kittens Game* involves advancing your technology to unlock specialized buildings, employing Geologists, and utilizing late-game upgrades and policies.

Here are the primary methods for boosting coal production, drawing upon the available sources:

### 1. Utilizing Buildings and Upgrades

Coal is generated directly by specialized buildings and indirectly by upgrading existing industrial structures:

| Building/Upgrade | Technology Requirement | Effect on Coal Production | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Quarry** | **Geology** [1, 2] | Base production of **+0.015 Coal per Tick** [1]. | Quarries are listed as a source of coal [3]. |
| **Deep Mining** | **Steel** [4] | **Mines** produce an additional **+0.003 Coal per Tick** [5]. | Deep Mining is a workshop upgrade that allows Mines to produce coal [5]. |
| **Coal Furnace** | **Steel** [4] | **Smelters** produce an additional **+0.005 Coal per Tick** [5]. | Coal Furnace is a workshop upgrade that enables Smelters to produce coal [3, 5]. |
| **Electrolytic Smelting** | **Metallurgy** [6] | **Smelters** produce **+95% more iron and coal** [7]. | This workshop upgrade significantly boosts Smelter output [7]. |
| **Pyrolysis** | **Physics** [8] | Boosts Coal production by **+20%** (multiplies with other effects) [7]. | This workshop upgrade does **not** affect Smelters [7]. |

### 2. The Geologist Job

The **Geologist** job is a dedicated profession for coal production and can be significantly enhanced by high-tier technology:

*   **Unlocking:** The job is unlocked by researching **Geology** [2, 9].
*   **Base Production:** Geologists initially produce **+0.015 Coal per Tick** [9].
*   **Geodesy:** Researching the **Geodesy** workshop upgrade (unlocked by Geology and costing Titanium and Starcharts [2, 5]) improves Geologist output by an additional **+0.0075 coal/tick** [5]. Once Geodesy is active, Geologists also gain the ability to find gold [5].
*   **Mining Drill:** This workshop upgrade (unlocked by Metallurgy) makes Geologists more effective, providing **+0.01 coal/tick** (if Geodesy is researched) [5]. Acquiring this upgrade is often recommended in the late-game for the coal grind needed for Oil Wells [10].
*   **Unobtainium Drill:** This high-tier upgrade (unlocked by **Exogeology**) further increases Geologist effectiveness by **+0.015 coal/tick** (if Geodesy is researched) [5].

In the late game, once **Geodesy** is researched, your kittens working as Geologists become the main source of coal, iron, and titanium (via trades) [11].

### 3. Policies and Cycles (Multipliers)

Specific late-game policies and timing mechanisms can provide percentage bonuses to coal income:

*   **Communism Policy:** Choosing the **Communism** policy (unlocked by building a Factory and having Autocracy or Republic [12]) grants a **+25% iron, coal, and titanium production** bonus [12].
*   **Umbra Cycle Festival:** If you have researched **Numeromancy**, holding a festival during the **Umbra cycle** (which lasts 5 years) multiplies **coal, iron, titanium, and gold income by 1.5** [13].

### 4. External Acquisition

If production is insufficient, you can acquire coal through trade:

*   **Spiders:** Coal is a **common resource** that can be **bought from the Spiders** in exchange for **Scaffold** [3, 14].
*   **Seasonal Trade:** Coal trading with Spiders is most favorable during the **Autumn** season, which provides a **+15% Amount Modifier** [15].
*   **Storage:** Coal, like many basic resources, has a default maximum storage capacity, which starts at **60** [16]. This can be increased by storage buildings like **Barns** and **Warehouses** [17]. The **Barges** upgrade for Harbors specifically increases coal storage by **50%** (multiplies with other effects) [18].
