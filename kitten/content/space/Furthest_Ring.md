The [Furthest Ring]( {{< relref "planet/Furthest_Ring.md" >}}) is the final space mission currently available in the sources, famously described as "**the end of the universe**". It represents the ultimate frontier of exploration for your kitten civilisation, situated far beyond the Centaurus System.

### **Mission Costs and Prerequisites**
Launching a rocket to the Furthest Ring requires an astronomical amount of high-tier resources, far exceeding any previous mission:
*   **Starcharts:** 500,000
*   [Science:]( {{< relref "resource/science.md" >}}) 1.25 Million
*   [Kerosene:]( {{< relref "resource/kerosene.md" >}}) 75,000
*   [Thorium:]( {{< relref "resource/thorium.md" >}}) 75,000

To even see this mission in the Ground Control tab, you must first successfully complete the [Centaurus System mission]( {{< relref "space/Centaurus_System_Mission.md" >}}).

### **The Travel Time Challenge**
The most defining characteristic of the Furthest Ring is its extreme distance. The base travel time is **725,200,000 game-days**. Even with the most advanced propulsion technologies researched, the journey is incredibly long:
*   **Drive Reductions:** By researching both [Thorium Drives]( {{< relref "upgrade/Thorium_Drive.md" >}}) and [Antimatter Drives]( {{< relref "upgrade/Antimatter_Drive.md" >}}), travel times are divided by 75.
*   **Real-Time Duration:** Even with these upgrades, the trip takes approximately **223 days, 19 hours, and 51 minutes** of real-world time (representing over 24,000 in-game years).
*   **Acceleration:** To progress this mission within a reasonable timeframe, you would typically need to rely on **combusting Time Crystals** to skip through years rapidly.

### **Functionality and Content**
Despite its name and the massive investment required, the Furthest Ring serves more as a symbolic endgame milestone than a functional colony site in the current version of the sources:
*   **No Structures:** As of version 1.4.6.2.b, there are **no structures** that can be built in the Furthest Ring.
*   **Interface:** Later updates (v1.4.8.5) introduced a **text-based interface** for players who reach the destination, though its specific unlocks remain listed as "TBD" (To Be Determined).
*   **Offline Interaction:** When the game is in offline mode, the sources note that the interface will simply state that the "**Furthest ring is empty**".

Because of the extreme time and resource requirements, reaching the Furthest Ring is considered a long-term goal for the most advanced, late-game "Phase 4" civilisations that have already established a self-sustaining **positive chrono-reset engine**.
