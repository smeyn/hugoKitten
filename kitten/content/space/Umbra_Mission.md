The [Umbra Mission]( {{< relref "space/Umbra_Mission.md" >}}) is a late-game space project focused on exploring the supermassive black hole located at the centre of the Helios system. It represents a significant step into the furthest reaches of the star system, transitioning the colony into the deepest "Phase 3" of developmental progression.

### **Mission Logistics and Prerequisites**
To launch the Umbra mission, your kittens must have already successfully explored [Yarn]( {{< relref "planet/Yarn.md" >}}). The resource requirements are substantial, reflecting the mission's late-game status:
*   **Starcharts:** 25,000
*   [Science:]( {{< relref "resource/science.md" >}}) 500,000
*   [Kerosene:]( {{< relref "resource/kerosene.md" >}}) 25,000
*   [Thorium:]( {{< relref "resource/thorium.md" >}}) 15,000

Successfully completing the launch unlocks the **Umbra Planet** and the subsequent [Charon Mission]( {{< relref "space/Charon_Mission.md" >}}).

### **The Umbra Cycle and Festivals**
"Umbra" is also one of the ten five-year celestial cycles (represented by the glyph **⍦**). If you have researched **Numerology** and [Numeromancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/numeromancy.md" >}}), the cycle provides the following modifiers:
*   **Production Penalties:** During this cycle, Planet Cracker uranium output is reduced by **10%** and Hydraulic Fracturer oil output decreases by **25%**.
*   **Production Boosts:** Energy production from **HR Harvesters** (located on the Umbra planet) is increased by **50%**.
*   **Festival Multipliers:** Holding a festival during the Umbra cycle provides a **1.5x income multiplier** for coal, iron, titanium, and gold.

### **Umbra Infrastructure: HR Harvesters**
The primary structure available on the Umbra planet is the **HR Harvester** (Hawking Radiation Harvester). These are unique energy-producing structures with the following characteristics:
*   **Cost:** 25 Relics and 1,250 Antimatter.
*   **Energy Generation:** They generate energy based on black hole evaporation, providing a base of **1 Watt** that increases over time.
*   **Scaling:** The output is boosted by **Dark Future years** (years beyond 40,000) and **Void Rifts**, which provide a **+10% boost per rift**.

### **Strategic Context**
In the broader scope of the sources' endgame guides, the Umbra mission is part of the "Mid-Game" transition into chasing relics and established cryptotheology. Because the mission requires **15,000 Thorium**, it necessitates a stable uranium-to-thorium refinement pipeline and high science caps, which are typically supported by earlier structures like **Space Beacons** and **Research Vessels**. Furthermore, the mission marks the point where [Antimatter]( {{< relref "resource/Antimatter.md" >}}) becomes a primary construction material for planetary infrastructure.
