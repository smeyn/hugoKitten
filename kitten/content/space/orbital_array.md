An [Orbital Array]( {{< relref "space/orbital_array.md" >}}) is a high-tier space structure in the Cath solar system that provides a **2% bonus to all space structures**. While powerful, it is an energy-intensive building, consuming **20 Watts** of power per unit.

### **Construction Requirements**
To build an Orbital Array, you must have unlocked the [Piscine mission]( {{< relref "space/Piscine_Mission.md" >}}). The base resource costs are substantial:
*   [Science:]( {{< relref "resource/science.md" >}}) 250,000
*   [Eludium:]( {{< relref "resource/eludium.md" >}}) 100
*   [Kerosene:]( {{< relref "resource/kerosene.md" >}}) 500
*   **Starchart:** 2,000
*   **Price Ratio:** 1.15

### **Strategic Synergies and Scaling**
The primary utility of the Orbital Array is scaling late-game resource production, particularly [Unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}}) from Lunar Outposts. Its effectiveness is significantly amplified by the following:
*   [Space Manufacturing:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Space_Manufacturing.md" >}}) Once this workshop upgrade is researched, **Factories** provide a bonus to the effectiveness of Orbital Arrays. The bonus is calculated as **3.75% per factory** (or 4.5% with the Factory Logistics upgrade).
*   **Production Formula:** The global space production bonus is calculated using the number of Space Elevators and Orbital Arrays, meaning they work together to exponentially increase output from structures like Planet Crackers and Lunar Outposts.

### **Efficiency and Profitability Analysis**
In endgame strategy, players often debate whether Orbital Arrays are worth the high [Eludium]( {{< relref "resource/eludium.md" >}}) cost during short runs:
*   **Short Runs vs. Long Runs:** In runs shorter than 30 to 60 minutes, most strategic guides suggest **ignoring Orbital Arrays** and Moon Bases, instead prioritizing Space Elevators because they are more cost-effective.
*   **The Eludium Bottleneck:** Because Eludium is a crafted resource, its cost effectively consumes 1,000 Unobtainium per unit (modified by craft ratio). Consequently, an array is only considered profitable if the remaining time in the run allows it to generate more Unobtainium than was spent on its construction. 
*   **Break-even Calculation:** To determine if an array is "worth it," players can calculate their **OF** (Outposts multiplied by Factories) and compare the projected Unobtainium gain against the cost of the next array level.

### **Role in the "Path to Infinity"**
During the final "Phase 4" of development—aimed at achieving a self-sustaining reset loop—Orbital Arrays are essential for maximizing the **Unobtainium generation rate**. This rate is critical for trading with Leviathans for [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}) and [Relics]( {{< relref "resource/relic.md" >}}), which eventually allow the player to bypass traditional resource mining altogether.
