The [Orbital Launch]( {{< relref "space/Orbital_Launch.md" >}}) mission serves as the critical gateway in the sources, transitioning the colony from terrestrial development to the **Space era**. It is the first project available in the "Ground Control" section of the Space tab once the [Rocketry]( {{< relref "techs/Rocketry.md" >}}) technology has been researched. For a standard game run, the launch requires a stockpile of **250 Starcharts, 5,000 Catpower, 100,000 Science, and 15,000 Oil**.

### **Requirements and Challenge Variations**
The resource demands for this mission change significantly depending on the active game mode:
*   **Standard Costs:** As noted, the primary hurdles are the science and oil caps.
*   **Black Sky Challenge:** In this mode, the Starchart requirement is removed entirely (0). However, to compensate, the mission requires **1.1 million Science, 55,000 Catpower, and 165,000 Oil**, representing an 11-fold increase for non-starchart resources.

### **Unlocks and Infrastructure**
Successfully completing the Orbital Launch provides access to the foundational structures and locations of the star system:
*   **Missions and Locations:** It unlocks the [Moon Mission]( {{< relref "space/Moon_Mission.md" >}}) and makes the planet [Cath]( {{< relref "planet/Cath.md" >}}) accessible.
*   **Satellite Deployment:** Players can begin deploying [Satellites]( {{< relref "techs/Satellites.md" >}}), which consume energy to provide a passive income of **Starcharts** (0.005/sec) and increase the science storage capacity of Observatories by 5%.
*   [Space Elevator:]( {{< relref "space/space_elevator.md" >}}) This structure is essential for long-term expansion as it provides a **1% bonus to all space structures** and reduces the oil requirements for future space missions and buildings by 5% (up to a 75% discount with diminishing returns).
*   **Space Stations:** These provide a 50% science bonus and housing for **+2 kittens**.

### **Strategic Considerations**
*   **The Oil Bottleneck:** Strategic guides highlight that **Oil management** is the dominant constraint at this stage. While the launch itself costs 15,000 Oil, the next mission requires 45,000, and the first Moon Base requires 70,000, necessitating a rapid increase in [Oil Wells]( {{< relref "buildings/Oil_Well.md" >}}) and storage.
*   **Resource Pivot:** This milestone marks the end of "Phase 1" and "Phase 2" of the game; once space is unlocked, common terrestrial resources begin to matter less as the economy shifts toward **Uranium, Unobtainium, and Antimatter**.
*   **Iron Will Mode:** In this specialized mode, achieving an Orbital Launch is a prerequisite for obtaining the **Space Oddity** gold star achievement. Players in this mode often find the Catpower and Gold requirements for space missions particularly challenging due to the lack of a kitten workforce.
