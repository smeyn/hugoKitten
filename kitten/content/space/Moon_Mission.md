The [Moon Mission]( {{< relref "space/Moon_Mission.md" >}}) is a pivotal space project in *Kittens Game* that involves launching a rocket to [Redmoon]( {{< relref "planet/Redmoon.md" >}}), a satellite of the planet Cath. It represents the first major step into space exploration beyond orbital deployment and is the primary gateway to the **Unobtainium Era**.

### **Mission Requirements and Logistics**
*   **Prerequisites:** You must first research [Rocketry]( {{< relref "techs/Rocketry.md" >}}) and successfully complete the [Orbital Launch]( {{< relref "space/Orbital_Launch.md" >}}) mission.
*   **Resource Costs:** The launch requires **500 Starcharts**, **5000 Titanium**, **125k Science**, and **45k Oil**.
*   **Travel Time:** The journey to Redmoon takes **30 game-days**, which is approximately **1 minute** in real-time. This can be further reduced by drive upgrades like the Antimatter or Thorium Drives.

### **Unlocks and Infrastructure**
Successfully completing the Moon Mission is essential for unlocking the infrastructure required to produce and store advanced materials:
*   [Lunar Outpost:]( {{< relref "planet/lunar_outpost.md" >}}) A nuclear-powered mining facility that is the primary source of [Unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}}). It consumes 1.75 uranium per second to produce 0.035 unobtainium per second.
*   **Moon Base:** A vital storage building that provides a base capacity of **+150 Unobtainium**, along with significant boosts to other resources such as **Catnip (+45k)**, Wood (+25k), and Titanium (+1250).
*   **Subsequent Missions:** Completing the Moon Mission is a prerequisite for launching missions to [Dune]( {{< relref "planet/Dune.md" >}}) and [Piscine]( {{< relref "planet/Piscine.md" >}}).

### **Strategic Importance**
*   **The Unobtainium Bottleneck:** Progressing past the mid-game is heavily gated by [Unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}}), which is required for Metaphysics upgrades and the high-tier [Eludium]( {{< relref "resource/eludium.md" >}}) alloy.
*   **Oil Management:** A major hurdle for this mission is oil storage. While the mission itself costs 45k oil, building the first **Moon Base** (which is necessary to store enough unobtainium for [Unobtainium Huts]( {{< relref "upgrade/Unobtainium_Huts.md" >}})) requires **70k oil**. Players often need to build numerous Oil Wells or tankers to reach these caps.
*   **Resource Scaling:** The effectiveness of Moon Bases can be significantly boosted by the [AI Bases]( {{< relref "upgrade/AI_Bases.md" >}}) upgrade, which adds a 10% storage bonus per [AI Core]( {{< relref "buildings/AI_Core.md" >}}).
*   **Challenges:** In the **Black Sky Challenge**, the starchart requirement for the preceding Orbital Launch is removed, but science and oil costs are significantly increased, making the path to the Moon Mission more difficult.

### **Economic Utility**
Beyond unobtainium, the **Catnip storage** provided by Moon Bases (45k) is critical for surviving the harsh food penalties of **Winter** in the late game, especially during challenges like "Winter Has Come" where the seasonal cycle is permanently frozen in winter.
