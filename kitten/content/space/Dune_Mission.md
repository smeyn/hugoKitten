The [Dune Mission]( {{< relref "space/Dune_Mission.md" >}}) is a mid-to-late game space project that involves launching a rocket to explore Dune, described as a large, lifeless planet covered by sand and volcanic rock. It serves as a critical bridge for industrial scaling, particularly in stabilizing the uranium and oil supplies required for advanced space exploration.

### **Mission Requirements and Logistics**
To access the Dune mission, you must have first successfully completed the [Moon mission]( {{< relref "space/Moon_Mission.md" >}}). The specific resource costs for the launch include:
*   **Starcharts:** 1,000.
*   [Titanium:]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) 7,000.
*   [Science:]( {{< relref "resource/science.md" >}}) 175,000.
*   [Kerosene:]( {{< relref "resource/kerosene.md" >}}) 75.

The base travel time for the mission is **356 game-days**, which equates to approximately **11 minutes and 52 seconds** in real-time. This duration can be reduced significantly by researching drive upgrades such as the [Antimatter Drive]( {{< relref "upgrade/Antimatter_Drive.md" >}}) or [Thorium Drive]( {{< relref "upgrade/Thorium_Drive.md" >}}).

### **Unlocked Infrastructure and Resources**
Successfully exploring Dune unlocks the [Helios mission]( {{< relref "space/Helios_Mission.md" >}}) and provides access to several vital space structures:
*   [Planet Cracker:]( {{< relref "space/planet_cracker.md" >}}) A massive mining vessel that produces **1.5 uranium per second** and increases uranium storage by **1,750**. This is a primary source of uranium needed to power [Lunar Outposts]( {{< relref "planet/lunar_outpost.md" >}}) for unobtainium production.
*   **Hydraulic Fracturer:** Produces oil at a rate of **2.5 per second**. While helpful for oil management, these structures are notably more effective once you have researched [Space Manufacturing]( {{< relref "upgrade/Space_Manufacturing.md" >}}).
*   [Spice Refinery:]( {{< relref "space/spice_refinery.md" >}}) Refines the planet's sand into [Spice]( {{< relref "resource/spice.md" >}}) at 0.125 per second. Spice is a rare luxury resource that provides a **+10% happiness boost** but is gradually consumed over time.

### **Technological and Policy Unlocks**
Reaching Dune is a prerequisite for advanced societal and scientific developments. It allows the research of **Cosmological Technocracy** and unlocks the ability to enact high-tier Policy/:
*   [Technocracy:]( {{< relref "Policy/Technocracy.md" >}}) Increases the science cap by 20%.
*   [Cosmological Libertarianism:]( {{< relref "Policy/Cosmological_Libertarianism.md" >}}) Increases unobtainium production by 15%.
*   [Order of the Stars:]( {{< relref "Policy/Order_of_the_Stars.md" >}}) Increases faith production by 20% but restricts leaders to the priest job.

### **The Dune Cycle and Synergy**
Dune is also one of the ten celestial cycles (represented by the glyph **⍫**). If you have researched **Numerology**, the Dune cycle provides specific modifiers to your space production:
*   **Planet Cracker uranium output:** +10%.
*   **Hydraulic Fracturer oil output:** +50%.
*   **HR Harvester energy production:** -25% penalty.
*   **Festival Effect:** If [Numeromancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/numeromancy.md" >}}) is researched, holding a festival during the Dune cycle provides a **2x multiplier to uranium income**.

### **Strategic Utility**
The mission marks the transition into the **Eludium Era**. Because Planet Crackers provide a more stable and faster uranium supply than terrestrial Accelerators or trading with Dragons, the Dune mission is essential for players looking to mass-produce [unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}}) and eventually [eludium]( {{< relref "resource/eludium.md" >}}). Additionally, the spice produced here provides a reliable way to maintain kitten happiness as populations grow larger.
