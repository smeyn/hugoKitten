The [Yarn Mission]( {{< relref "space/Yarn_Mission.md" >}}) is a late-game space exploration project that involves travelling to Yarn, a **Class M planet** within the Helios star system. It is described as having a moderate climate, oxygen atmosphere, and seas.

### **Mission Logistics and Unlocks**
*   **Prerequisites:** Players must successfully complete the [Helios Mission]( {{< relref "space/Helios_Mission.md" >}}) before the Yarn Mission becomes available in the "Ground Control" section of the Space tab.
*   **Launch Costs:** The mission requires a significant investment of resources: **7,500 Starcharts, 35,000 Titanium, 350,000 Science, and 12,000 Kerosene**.
*   **Travel Time:** The base travel time is **3,800 game-days**, which is approximately **2 hours, 6 minutes, and 40 seconds** in real-time. This duration can be reduced significantly by researching [Thorium]( {{< relref "resource/thorium.md" >}}) or [Antimatter Drives]( {{< relref "upgrade/Antimatter_Drive.md" >}}).
*   **Sequential Unlocks:** Completing this mission unlocks the **Yarn Planet** and the subsequent mission to [Umbra]( {{< relref "planet/Umbra.md" >}}).

### **Yarn Infrastructure**
Once the planet is reached, two specialized structures can be developed to scale the colony’s population and agricultural efficiency:
*   **Terraforming Station:** Costs **25 Antimatter, 5,000 Uranium, and 5,000 Kerosene**. It provides **+1 maximum kitten** capacity.
*   [Hydroponics:]( {{< relref "techs/Hydroponics.md" >}}) Requires the **Hydroponics technology** and costs **1 Unobtainium and 500 Kerosene**. It increases **maximum catnip by 10%**, catnip production by **2.5%**, and provides a **1.0% bonus** to the kitten capacity of Terraforming Stations. Hydroponics also increases the overall **catnip storage capacity by 10%**, which stacks additively with the [Refrigeration]( {{< relref "upgrade/Refrigeration.md" >}}) upgrade.

### **The Yarn Cycle**
"Yarn" is also the name of one of the ten five-year cycles in the game (represented by the glyph **⍧**). If **Numerology** has been researched, the Yarn cycle provides the following modifiers:
*   **Production Bonuses:** **Hydroponics catnip production is increased by 100%**.
*   **Production Penalties:** **Research Vessel starchart production is reduced by 50%**.
*   **Festival Effect:** If [Numeromancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/numeromancy.md" >}}) is also researched, holding a festival during the Yarn cycle provides a **2x multiplier to culture income**.

### **Strategic Importance**
In the late game, terraforming Yarn is a primary strategy for players aiming to maximize their **kitten population** (potentially reaching upwards of 60,000 kittens) to farm larger amounts of [Paragon]( {{< relref "resource/paragon.md" >}}) during long runs. This is achieved by stacking **Terraforming Stations** and leveraging the scaling bonuses from [Hydroponics]( {{< relref "techs/Hydroponics.md" >}}) and [AI Cores]( {{< relref "buildings/AI_Core.md" >}}).
