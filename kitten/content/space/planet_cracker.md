A [Planet Cracker]( {{< relref "space/planet_cracker.md" >}}) (specifically the USS Mining Vessel *Hissmeowra*) is a massive space-based mining structure used to extract large quantities of [Uranium]( {{< relref "resource/uranium.md" >}}) from the planet Dune. It is a critical component for transitioning into the **Eludium Era**, as it provides the steady Uranium supply required for [Lunar Outposts]( {{< relref "planet/lunar_outpost.md" >}}) to refine into [Unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}}).

### **Acquisition and Costs**
The structure is found in the Space tab once the player has successfully landed on [Dune]( {{< relref "planet/Dune.md" >}}).
*   **Prerequisite:** You must complete the [Dune Mission]( {{< relref "space/Dune_Mission.md" >}}) (which costs 1,000 Starcharts, 7,000 Titanium, 175k Science, and 75 Kerosene).
*   **Cost:** Each Planet Cracker costs **2,500 Starcharts, 1,750 Alloy, 125,000 Science, and 50 Kerosene**.
*   **Price Ratio:** 1.18.

### **Core Effects**
*   **Uranium Production:** Generates **1.5 Uranium per second**.
*   **Uranium Storage:** Increases your maximum Uranium capacity by **1,750**.
*   **Capacity Boost:** Upgrading a Warehouse to a **Spaceport** increases the capacity of Planet Crackers by **0.85%**.

### **Upgrades and Scaling**
The effectiveness of a Planet Cracker can be significantly enhanced through various technological and industrial milestones:
*   [Planet Busters:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Planet_Busters.md" >}}) This upgrade, available via the **Exometallurgy** (Advanced Exogeology) technology, increases the Uranium output of Planet Crackers by **100%** (effectively doubling it).
*   [Space Manufacturing:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Space_Manufacturing.md" >}}) Once researched, **Factories** provide a bonus to Planet Crackers (and other space structures) based on your factory craft ratio.
*   **Space Production Bonus:** Output is also boosted by the combined bonuses from [Space Elevators]( {{< relref "space/space_elevator.md" >}}) and [Orbital Arrays]( {{< relref "space/orbital_array.md" >}}).

### **Cycle and Environmental Modifiers**
If the player has researched **Numerology**, the current celestial cycle impacts the vessel's efficiency:
*   [Dune Cycle:]( {{< relref "Cycles/Dune_Cycle.md" >}}) Uranium output is increased by **10%**.
*   [Umbra Cycle:]( {{< relref "Cycles/Umbra_Cycle.md" >}}) Uranium output is reduced by **10%**.
*   **Pollution:** High levels of CO2 and pollution in the atmosphere can harm resource production and may reduce the effectiveness of the production bonuses applied to these structures.

### **Strategic Importance**
The Planet Cracker is the most efficient method for generating the massive amounts of Uranium needed in the late game. For context, a [Lunar Outpost]( {{< relref "planet/lunar_outpost.md" >}}) consumes Uranium at a rate of **1.75 per second**, meaning a single un-upgraded Planet Cracker (producing 1.5/sec) almost entirely offsets the cost of one outpost. Without this stable supply, players must rely on Accelerators or trading with Dragons, which are significantly slower and less reliable for sustaining large-scale Unobtainium production.
