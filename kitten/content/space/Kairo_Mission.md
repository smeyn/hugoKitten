The [Kairo Mission]( {{< relref "space/Kairo_Mission.md" >}}) is a late-game space project that involves travelling to a dwarf planet located at the far end of the Cath solar system. Completing this mission is a crucial step for advancing your colony’s scientific capacity and transitioning into the relic-production phase of the game.

### **Mission Logistics and Costs**
To launch a rocket to Kairo, you must have successfully completed the [T-minus mission]( {{< relref "space/T-minus_Mission.md" >}}). The resource requirements for the launch are substantial:
*   **Starcharts:** 5,000
*   [Titanium:]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) 20,000
*   [Science:]( {{< relref "resource/science.md" >}}) 300,000
*   [Kerosene:]( {{< relref "resource/kerosene.md" >}}) 7,500

The mission has a travel time of **5,000 game-days**, which is approximately **2 hours, 46 minutes, and 40 seconds** in real-time. This duration can be significantly reduced by researching drive upgrades like the Thorium or Antimatter Drives.

### **Unlocks and Infrastructure**
Successfully exploring Kairo provides access to the following:
*   **The Rorschach Mission:** Unlocks the next stage of deep-space exploration.
*   **Space Beacons:** This is the primary infrastructure unlocked by the mission. Each Space Beacon costs 25,000 Starcharts, 50 Antimatter, 25,000 Alloy, and 7,500 Kerosene. 
    *   **Science Boost:** Every Space Beacon provides a massive **+25,000 bonus to maximum science storage**.
    *   **Starchart Production:** They generate **0.125 starcharts per second**.
    *   **Relic Production:** Once upgraded with a [Relic Station]( {{< relref "upgrade/Relic_Station.md" >}}), Space Beacons become a primary source of passive relics, yielding **0.01 relics per day** (scaled by your current antimatter storage).

### **The Kairo Cycle**
Kairo is also the name of one of the **ten five-year cycles** that govern the Cath solar system. If you have researched **Numerology** and [Numeromancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/numeromancy.md" >}}), the Kairo cycle and associated festivals provide unique modifiers:
*   **Space Modifiers:** During this cycle, the Space Beacon’s starchart production is boosted by **+400%**, though it imposes a **-25% to -50% penalty** on the science bonuses of Space Stations and Satellites, as well as the Space Elevator's production bonus.
*   **Festival Effect:** Holding a festival during the Kairo cycle provides a massive **5x multiplier to starchart income**.

### **Strategic Utility**
In the late game, the Kairo mission is essential for overcoming the **science storage ceiling**. While early-game buildings like Libraries and Academies provide modest caps, the +25,000 boost from each Space Beacon is necessary to afford the multi-million science costs of endgame technologies. Additionally, Space Beacons are the foundation of the **"Type 1 Relic Engine,"** where they are used alongside Relic Stations and Black Nexuses to automate relic generation.
