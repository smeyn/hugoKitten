The [Space Elevator]( {{< relref "space/space_elevator.md" >}}) is a foundational space structure in the sources, situated on the planet Cath, that serves as a critical bridge between terrestrial industry and orbital expansion. It is unlocked following a successful [Orbital Launch]( {{< relref "space/Orbital_Launch.md" >}}) and requires the research of both **Orbital Engineering and Nanotechnology**.

### **Costs and Core Effects**
The structure requires **6,000 Titanium, 75,000 Science, and 50 Unobtainium** to construct, featuring a price ratio of **1.15**. Its primary benefits include:
*   **Oil Efficiency:** It reduces the oil requirements for space missions and buildings by **5%** per level. This effect is subject to diminishing returns and is capped at a **75% reduction**.
*   **Space Structure Bonus:** It provides a flat **1% bonus** to the effectiveness of all other space structures.
*   **Production Transfer:** It transfers **0.1% of your global production** specifically to **Hydraulic Fracturers** and **Spice Refineries** on Dune.

### **Strategic Synergies and Scaling**
The true utility of Space Elevators depends heavily on late-game technological integration. The sources emphasize that Space Elevators are **not particularly worth their cost** until the [Space Manufacturing]( {{< relref "upgrade/Space_Manufacturing.md" >}}) workshop upgrade is researched. 
*   **Space Manufacturing Interaction:** Once unlocked, each [Factory]( {{< relref "buildings/Factory.md" >}}) provides a bonus to space production (3.75% per factory, or 4.5% with [Factory Logistics]( {{< relref "upgrade/Factory_Logistics.md" >}})) that amplifies the base bonus provided by Space Elevators.
*   **Cycle Modifiers:** If **Numerology** is researched, the **Cath cycle** doubles the transferred production bonus for oil, while the [Kairo cycle]( {{< relref "Cycles/Kairo_Cycle.md" >}}) reduces the overall transferred production bonus by **50%**.

### **Endgame Utility and Management**
In the late game, Space Elevators become a primary driver for [Unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}}) and **Time Crystal** farming.
*   **Unobtainium Production:** They are essential for boosting the output of [Lunar Outposts]( {{< relref "planet/lunar_outpost.md" >}}). Strategic advice suggests prioritizing the purchase of Space Elevators over Moon Bases and Orbital Arrays during short runs.
*   **Profitability Calculations:** Advanced players use a "break-even" formula to determine if building another elevator is worth it based on the remaining time in a run. For example, if the calculated gain in unobtainium is greater than half the construction cost, it is profitable to build and later sell the structure.
*   **Reset Procedure:** Because Space Elevators do not carry over during a reset, the sources recommend **selling them all** immediately before resetting to reclaim 50% of the invested resources.
