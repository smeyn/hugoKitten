The [T-minus mission]( {{< relref "space/T-minus_Mission.md" >}}) is a significant mid-to-late-game space project in *Kittens Game* that involves travelling to **Terminus**, described as a **supermassive ice giant** located at the far end of the Helios solar system. This mission serves as a critical bridge between the mid-game industry and the advanced resource management required for late-game space exploration.

### **Mission Logistics and Costs**
To launch a mission to Terminus, you must first successfully complete the [Piscine mission]( {{< relref "space/Piscine_Mission.md" >}}). The resource requirements for the launch are as follows:
*   **Starcharts:** 2,500
*   [Titanium:]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) 12,000
*   [Science:]( {{< relref "resource/science.md" >}}) 225,000
*   [Kerosene:]( {{< relref "resource/kerosene.md" >}}) 750

The base travel time for the mission is **2,500 game-days**, which is approximately **1 hour, 23 minutes, and 20 seconds** in real-time. As with other missions, this duration can be divided by 25 with an Antimatter Drive, 50 with a Thorium Drive, or **75 if both are researched**.

### **Critical Unlocks: Cryostations**
Successfully completing the T-minus mission unlocks the [Kairo mission]( {{< relref "space/Kairo_Mission.md" >}}) and the **T-Minus planet**, but its most strategically vital unlock is the **Cryostation**. Cryostations are massive storage facilities that provide essential boosts to your global caps:
*   **Storage Gains:** Each station increases the maximum capacity for **Wood and Minerals (+200K)**, **Iron (+50K)**, **Titanium (+7,500)**, **Uranium (+5,000)**, **Oil (+7,500)**, **Unobtainium (+750)**, and **Coal (+25K)**.
*   **Titanium Bottleneck:** Cryostations are identified as one of the most effective ways to increase titanium storage, which is necessary to reach the **125K cap** required for the [Space Manufacturing]( {{< relref "upgrade/Space_Manufacturing.md" >}}) upgrade.
*   **Unobtainium Progression:** Because they provide 750 unobtainium storage each, they are also a primary method for reaching the 1,000-unit threshold required for the **Eludium Era**.

### **The T-minus Cycle**
"T-minus" is also one of the ten five-year cycles within the Helios system, represented by the glyph **⍝**. If you have researched **Numerology** or [Numeromancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/numeromancy.md" >}}), this cycle introduces specific global modifiers:
*   **Production and Storage:** During this cycle, **Sunlifter energy output is reduced by 50%**, but **Cryostation storage capacity is increased by 20%**. 
*   **Festival Effect:** Holding a festival during the T-minus cycle provides an **Oil income x2** multiplier.

### **Strategic Utility**
In the broader progression of the game, the T-minus mission is a gateway to "Phase 4," where the player begins to focus on **chrono-optimization and geometric growth**. By providing a massive leap in storage capacity through Cryostations, it allows kittens to store the high-tier materials (like Eludium and Unobtainium) needed to build [Chronospheres]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}) and prepare for self-sustaining resets.
