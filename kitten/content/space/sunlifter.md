A [Sunlifter]( {{< relref "space/sunlifter.md" >}}) is a high-tier space structure built in the center of the Helios solar system, serving as the primary engine for **antimatter production** and late-game energy generation. It is a critical component for transitioning into the Relic era and completing high-level challenges.

### **Acquisition and Costs**
To construct a Sunlifter, you must first complete the [Helios Mission]( {{< relref "space/Helios_Mission.md" >}}) (3,000 starcharts, 15k titanium, 250k science, and 1,250 kerosene).
*   **Structure Cost:** 500k Science, 225 Eludium, and 2,500 Kerosene.
*   **Price Ratio:** 1.15.
*   **Challenge Requirement:** Building at least one Sunlifter is a mandatory goal for completing the **Energy Challenge**.

### **Core Functions**
The Sunlifter provides two essential resources simultaneously:
1.  **Energy Production:** It generates **30 Watts** of energy. Alongside Hydro Plants, Sunlifters are the main focus for power generation in the late game.
2.  **Antimatter Generation:** It produces **1 antimatter per year**. Antimatter is only generated at the change of the calendar year and only if your global energy production is **positive**.

### **Celestial Cycle Interactions**
The effectiveness of Sunlifters is heavily influenced by the ten-cycle system if you have researched **Numerology**:
*   [Helios Cycle:]( {{< relref "Cycles/Helios_Cycle.md" >}}) Provides a **+50% bonus** to Sunlifter energy output.
*   **T-minus Cycle:** Imposes a **-50% penalty** to Sunlifter energy output.

### **Strategic Utility**
*   **The Relic Era:** Sunlifters are vital for reaching the **5,000 antimatter cap** required for [Relic Stations]( {{< relref "upgrade/Relic_Station.md" >}}). To achieve this cap, you will typically need to power a vast array of Heatsinks and Containment Chambers, which require massive energy surpluses provided by Sunlifters.
*   **Time Skipping:** Because antimatter is granted only once per year, players often use [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}) to "shatter" or skip years. This triggers the year-change logic repeatedly, allowing you to harvest antimatter from your Sunlifters much faster than waiting in real-time.
*   **Late-Game Power:** While Reactors provide significant power, they consume Thorium; Sunlifters provide a stable, "clean" alternative that is essential for maintaining the energy required for **Heatsinks** and **Containment Chambers**.
