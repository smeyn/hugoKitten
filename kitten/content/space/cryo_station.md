A **Cryostation** is a vast, high-tier space storage facility located on the ice giant **Terminus**. It is a critical structure for mid-to-late-game progression, specifically for overcoming the storage bottlenecks required to enter the Eludium era and establish Chronosphere resets.

### **Acquisition and Costs**
*   **Unlocking**: To build a Cryostation, you must first successfully complete the [T-minus mission]( {{< relref "space/T-minus_Mission.md" >}}) (which requires 2,500 starcharts, 12k titanium, 225k science, and 750 kerosene).
*   **Construction Cost**: Each station costs **200k Science, 25 Eludium, 1,500 Concrete, and 500 Kerosene**.
*   **Price Ratio**: It features a relatively low price ratio of **1.12**, making it easier to stack compared to terrestrial storage buildings.

### **Storage Capabilities**
The primary function of a Cryostation is its massive boost to resource caps. Each station provides the following base storage increases:
*   **Wood and Minerals**: +200,000
*   [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}): +7,500
*   **Oil**: +7,500
*   [Uranium]( {{< relref "resource/uranium.md" >}}): +5,000
*   **Iron**: +50,000
*   [Coal]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}): +25,000
*   [Unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}}): +750
*   **Note**: Unlike Moon Bases, Cryostations **do not provide any catnip storage**.

### **Strategic Importance**
*   **The Titanium Bottleneck**: Cryostations are one of the most effective ways to increase titanium storage, which is necessary to reach the **125k cap** required to research [Space Manufacturing]( {{< relref "upgrade/Space_Manufacturing.md" >}}).
*   **Unobtainium Era**: They are essential for reaching the **1,000 unobtainium storage** threshold needed to craft Eludium effectively.
*   **Endgame Chronospheres**: In the late game, Cryostations (along with Moon Bases) are the only buildings that provide unobtainium capacity. They are vital for reaching the multi-billion unobtainium caps required for massive [Chronosphere]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}) resets.

### **Environmental and Scaling Modifiers**
The effectiveness of Cryostations is influenced by the following factors:
*   **Celestial Cycles**: With Numerology researched, the **T-minus cycle** increases Cryostation storage by **+20%**, while the [Helios cycle]( {{< relref "Cycles/Helios_Cycle.md" >}}) reduces it by **-10%**.
*   **Spaceports**: Each Spaceport provides a **+0.85%** boost to the capacity of your Cryostations.
*   **Global Modifiers**: Storage capacity is further enhanced by your current [Paragon]( {{< relref "resource/paragon.md" >}}) (0.1% per point), **Event Horizons** (+10% each), and **Void Rifts** (+2% each).
*   **Sunforges**: These improve the storage of base metals (iron, titanium, uranium) by 1% per building.

### **Distinction from Cryochambers**
It is important not to confuse **Cryostations** with **Cryochambers**. While Cryostations are for resource storage, **Cryochambers** are found in the Time tab and are used to house and carry over individual kittens into your next game reset. Cryochambers require Time Crystals, Void, and Karma to build and are limited by the number of active Chronospheres you possess.
