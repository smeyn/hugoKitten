+++
The [Centaurus System Mission]( {{< relref "space/Centaurus_System_Mission.md" >}}) is a high-tier late-game space project that allows your kittens to travel to a warm, faraway star system. It represents one of the final stages of stellar exploration before reaching the theoretical "end of the universe".

### **Mission Logistics and Costs**
*   **Unlock Prerequisite:** You must first successfully complete the **Rorschach Mission** to unlock Centaurus.
*   **Resource Requirements:** The launch requires **100k Starcharts**, **40k Titanium**, **400k Science**, **50k Kerosene**, and **50k Thorium**.
*   **Travel Time:** The base travel time is **120,000 game-days**, which is approximately **2 days, 18 hours, and 40 minutes** in real-time. This can be reduced by a factor of **75** (bringing it down to roughly 53 minutes) if you have researched both [Thorium]( {{< relref "resource/thorium.md" >}}) and [Antimatter Drives]( {{< relref "upgrade/Antimatter_Drive.md" >}}).

### **Unlocked Infrastructure**
Successfully reaching the Centaurus System provides access to powerful energy-generating structures:
*   **Tectonic:** A massive industrial project that rips open the planet near the Centaurus star to collect magma energy. It costs **600k Science**, **500 Antimatter**, and **75k Thorium** to build and provides a base **+25 Energy Production**. It requires the [Terraformation]( {{< relref "techs/Terraformation.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Molten Core:** An advanced upgrade that costs **25M Science** and **5M Uranium**. Each level of Molten Core improves the effectiveness of Tectonic structures by **5%**. It requires the [Exophysics]( {{< relref "techs/Exophysics.md" >}}) technology.

### **Strategic Progression**
*   **Challenge Unlocks:** Completing the Centaurus Mission is the mandatory prerequisite to unlock the **Energy Challenge**. This challenge doubles energy consumption but rewards players with a permanent reduction in production penalties caused by negative energy.
*   [Furthest Ring:]( {{< relref "planet/Furthest_Ring.md" >}}) Reaching the Centaurus System is the final requirement before you can launch the mission to the [Furthest Ring]( {{< relref "planet/Furthest_Ring.md" >}}), described as the end of the universe.
*   **Endgame Utility:** Because this mission and its associated buildings require massive amounts of **Thorium, Antimatter, and Science**, it is typically undertaken only after the player has established a robust "Shatter Engine" and significant science storage through structures like **Space Beacons**.
