A [Spice Refinery]( {{< relref "space/spice_refinery.md" >}}) is a space-based industrial structure located on the planet [Dune]( {{< relref "planet/Dune.md" >}}). It is designed to refine the planet's sand into [Spice]( {{< relref "resource/spice.md" >}}), a rare and psychoactive luxury resource.

### **Acquisition and Costs**
The Spice Refinery becomes available once you have successfully completed the [Dune Mission]( {{< relref "space/Dune_Mission.md" >}}).
*   **Resource Requirements:** 500 Starcharts, 500 Alloy, 75,000 Science, and 125 Kerosene.
*   **Price Ratio:** 1.15.

### **Production and Synergies**
*   **Base Output:** Each refinery produces **0.125 Spice per second**.
*   **Space Elevator Synergy:** Space Elevators provide a specialized bonus to Spice Refineries, granting them **0.1% of your global production**.
*   **Automation:** While not directly listed as having specific "upgrades" like the Planet Cracker, its production can be amplified by general space production modifiers such as [Orbital Arrays]( {{< relref "space/orbital_array.md" >}}) (+2%) and [Space Manufacturing]( {{< relref "upgrade/Space_Manufacturing.md" >}}) (bonus based on factory craft ratio).

### **The Utility of Spice**
Spice is a "Rare Resource" that plays a critical role in colony happiness and late-game utility:
*   **Happiness Bonus:** Each unit of spice provides a **+10% happiness boost**. 
*   **Consumption:** Like other rare resources (furs and ivory), spice is **gradually consumed** over time. Consumption rates can be managed through Policy/:
    *   [Stoicism:]( {{< relref "Policy/Stoicism.md" >}}) Reduces spice consumption by **50%**.
    *   **Epicureanism/Extravagance:** Increases the happiness benefit of spice (up to 5 happiness points) but causes it to be consumed much faster (up to 200% rate).
*   **Brewery Interaction:** Spice is a required input for **Breweries**, which consume **0.1 spice per tick** to provide bonuses to festivals, such as increased happiness and kitten arrival speed.

### **Strategic Importance**
In the mid-to-late game, the Spice Refinery is the primary method for **automating** spice acquisition. Prior to reaching Dune, spice is only obtainable as a rare, random drop from [trading]( {{< relref "guides/trading.md" >}}) with other civilizations. By building refineries, you ensure a stable supply to maintain high kitten happiness and power your Breweries without relying on the RNG of trade.
