+++
The [Charon Mission]( {{< relref "space/Charon_Mission.md" >}}) is a significant late-game space project that takes your kittens to a small, incredibly dense dwarf planet on the far edge of the Helios system. Known colloquially as "**The Gates of Death**" due to its hostile and barren environment, it represents one of the final frontiers of planetary exploration before reaching the Centaurus system.

### **Mission Requirements and Unlocks**
*   **Prerequisite:** You must successfully complete the [Umbra Mission]( {{< relref "space/Umbra_Mission.md" >}}) before the Charon Mission becomes available.
*   **Launch Costs:** This project requires a massive stockpile of advanced resources: **75,000 Starcharts**, **750,000 Science**, **35,000 Kerosene**, and **35,000 Thorium**.
*   **Unlocks:** Successfully landing on the planet unlocks the **Charon Planet** tab and the ability to construct the **Entanglement Station**.

### **Entanglement Stations**
Once Charon is reached, you can build **Entanglement Stations**, which are essential for advanced quantum computing and hashrate generation.
*   **Cost:** Each station costs **1,250 Relics**, **5,250 Antimatter**, and **5,000 Eludium**.
*   **Function:** These stations consume 25 Wt of energy and **0.1 gigaflops per tick** (produced by AI Cores) to generate **0.1 hashes per tick**.
*   **Strategic Utility:** Hashes are used to increase your **hashrate level**, which provides a **+25% bonus to relic production** from Space Beacons for every level achieved. This is a core component of the "Antimatter Phase" of the endgame, where players aim to automate and scale relic generation.

### **The Charon Cycle**
"Charon" is also the first of the ten five-year celestial cycles, represented by the glyph **⍙**. If you have researched **Numerology** and [Numeromancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/numeromancy.md" >}}), the cycle introduces the following global modifiers:
*   **Production Penalties:** During this cycle, **Lunar Outpost unobtainium output is reduced by 10%**. 
*   **Operational Costs:** **Gigaflop consumption** for Entanglement Stations is increased by **+100%** (doubled).
*   **Festival Bonus:** Holding a festival during the Charon cycle provides a **1.5x income multiplier** for **catnip, wood, and minerals**.

### **Strategic Considerations**
The Charon Mission is often viewed as a major resource gate because of its [Thorium]( {{< relref "resource/thorium.md" >}}) and **Starchart** requirements. By this stage, players generally rely on a robust "Shatter Engine" to skip through non-productive years and harvest enough antimatter to afford the Entanglement Stations. Additionally, because Entanglement Stations consume gigaflops, players must carefully balance the number of [AI Cores]( {{< relref "buildings/AI_Core.md" >}}) and stations to prevent an **AI Apocalypse**, ensuring that gigaflop production stays ahead of consumption without allowing the AI level to reach critical thresholds.
