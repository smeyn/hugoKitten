The [Piscine Mission]( {{< relref "space/Piscine_Mission.md" >}}) is a mid-to-late game space project involving travel to a gigantic aquatic planet characterised by an acidic body and a methane atmosphere. It is a critical milestone for expanding your colony's scientific and astronomical infrastructure.

### **Requirements and Logistics**
*   **Prerequisites:** Players must first successfully complete the [Moon Mission]( {{< relref "space/Moon_Mission.md" >}}) to unlock the Piscine project.
*   **Launch Costs:** The mission requires **1500 Starcharts, 9000 Titanium, 200,000 Science, and 250 Kerosene**. 
*   **Travel Time:** The journey to Piscine takes **256 game-days**, which is approximately **8 minutes and 32 seconds** in real-time. This duration can be reduced using advanced drives like the Antimatter or Thorium Drives.

### **Critical Unlocks and Infrastructure**
Successfully exploring Piscine is the gateway to some of the most powerful starchart-generating structures in the star system:
*   **Research Vessels:** These mobile space stations provide a base **+10,000 science storage** and generate **0.05 starcharts per second**. The sources identify these vessels as the **most efficient method for generating starcharts**, outperforming Satellites by a factor of ten.
*   [Orbital Arrays:]( {{< relref "space/orbital_array.md" >}}) This space structure provides a **2% bonus to all space structures**, though it consumes a significant 20 Watts of energy.
*   **Future Exploration:** Completing this mission is required to unlock the [T-minus mission]( {{< relref "space/T-minus_Mission.md" >}}).

### **The Piscine Cycle**
In the game’s ten-cycle celestial system, the Piscine cycle (identified by the glyph **⎈**) introduces specific modifiers that players should manage strategically:
*   **Hydroponics production** suffers a **-50% penalty** to catnip generation.
*   **Research Vessel starchart production** is boosted by **+50%**.
*   **Science Multiplier:** If [Numeromancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/numeromancy.md" >}}) is researched, holding a festival during the Piscine cycle provides a **2x multiplier to Science income**.

### **Strategic Utility**
*   **Solving the Starchart Bottleneck:** The primary reason to rush the Piscine Mission is to transition from manual "astronomical event" clicking to the automated starchart production provided by Research Vessels. This is essential for building the massive trade fleets of [Trade Ships]( {{< relref "craft/Trade_Ship.md" >}}) required for late-game titanium and blueprint acquisitions.
*   **Science Progression:** With upgrades like [Antimatter Reactors]( {{< relref "upgrade/Antimatter_Reactors.md" >}}), the science storage of Research Vessels can be boosted by up to **400%**, providing a massive foundation for multi-million science technologies.
*   **Challenge Note:** It is important to note that Research Vessels **do not produce starcharts while in a Black Sky Challenge**, as this would circumvent the core difficulty of that mode.
