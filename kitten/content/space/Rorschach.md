[Rorschach]( {{< relref "space/Rorschach.md" >}})   is a late-game celestial body in the Helios star system, specifically described as the **biggest comet near Helios**. 

### **The Rorschach Mission**
To explore Rorschach, you must first successfully complete the [Kairo Mission]( {{< relref "space/Kairo_Mission.md" >}}). The mission represents a significant investment in late-game resources:
*   **Starcharts:** 15,000
*   [Titanium:]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) 80,000
*   [Science:]( {{< relref "resource/science.md" >}}) 500,000
*   [Kerosene:]( {{< relref "resource/kerosene.md" >}}) 25,000.

While travel times for space missions can be significantly reduced by researching [Thorium Drives]( {{< relref "upgrade/Thorium_Drive.md" >}}) (divided by 50) or [Antimatter Drives]( {{< relref "upgrade/Antimatter_Drive.md" >}}) (divided by 25), the base travel time for Rorschach is not explicitly listed alongside the other missions in the provided technical logs.

### **Strategic Impact and Unlocks**
The primary function of the Rorschach mission is to serve as a gateway to the furthest reaches of the star system:
*   **Expanded Vision:** Upon completion, the sources note that while Rorschach is "impenetrable," its discovery allows your kittens to **"see farther"**.
*   **Centaurus Mission:** Successfully exploring Rorschach is the mandatory prerequisite to unlock the **Centaurus Mission**, which leads to a warm, faraway star system.

### **Context in Late-Game Progression**
In the broader "Phase 4" of game progression, Rorschach is part of the deep-space exploration arc that follows the stabilization of the [Unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}}) and [Antimatter]( {{< relref "resource/Antimatter.md" >}}) economies. Because the mission requires a substantial **80,000 Titanium**, players often need to have reached the "Titanium Era" high-storage milestones—such as building numerous **Moon Bases, Cryostations,** or [Accelerators]( {{< relref "buildings/Accelerator.md" >}}) with the **Energy Rift** upgrade—to satisfy the mission's resource caps.
