+++

A **Hydraulic Fracturer** is a high-tier space structure situated on the planet [Dune]( {{< relref "planet/Dune.md" >}}) that produces a high-pressure stream of **oil**. It is a critical component of late-game resource management, specifically for sustaining the heavy oil requirements of the **Eludium Era**.

### **Acquisition and Costs**
To access this building, you must first reach the Space tab by researching [Rocketry]( {{< relref "techs/Rocketry.md" >}}) and successfully complete the [Dune Mission]( {{< relref "space/Dune_Mission.md" >}}). 
*   **Mission Requirements:** 1,000 Starcharts, 7,000 Titanium, 175k Science, and 75 Kerosene.
*   **Building Cost:** Each Hydraulic Fracturer costs **750 Starcharts, 1,025 Alloy, 150k Science, and 100 Kerosene**.
*   **Price Ratio:** The building has a price ratio of **1.18**.

### **Production and Scaling**
The base effect of a Hydraulic Fracturer is the production of **2.5 oil per second**. While powerful, its true utility comes from several late-game scaling mechanisms:
*   [Space Manufacturing:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Space_Manufacturing.md" >}}) Sources indicate that Hydraulic Fracturers are "not particularly effective" until the [Space Manufacturing]( {{< relref "upgrade/Space_Manufacturing.md" >}}) workshop upgrade is researched. Once active, **Factories** provide a bonus to space production (equivalent to 75% of the factory craft ratio), which significantly amplifies the output of these structures.
*   [Space Elevators:]( {{< relref "space/space_elevator.md" >}}) These terrestrial structures provide a unique synergy, granting **0.1% of your global production** specifically to Hydraulic Fracturers and Spice Refineries.
*   [Orbital Arrays:]( {{< relref "space/orbital_array.md" >}}) These provide a flat **2% bonus** to all space structures, including the Fracturer.

### **Environmental and Cyclical Modifiers**
If you have researched **Numerology**, the current celestial cycle will drastically alter the efficiency of your oil production on Dune:
*   [Dune Cycle:]( {{< relref "Cycles/Dune_Cycle.md" >}}) Provides a massive **+50% boost** to oil output.
*   [Umbra Cycle:]( {{< relref "Cycles/Umbra_Cycle.md" >}}) Imposes a **-25% penalty** to production.
*   **Festivals:** Under the [Numeromancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/numeromancy.md" >}}) upgrade, holding a festival during the **T-minus cycle** provides a **2x multiplier to oil income**, which further synergises with your Fracturer infrastructure.

### **Strategic Utility**
As you transition into the late game, oil becomes a significant bottleneck for producing [Kerosene]( {{< relref "resource/kerosene.md" >}}) and maintaining **Research Vessels**. While early-game oil management relies on Oil Wells and Bio Labs, the Hydraulic Fracturer is the primary method for scaling oil production to the levels required for deep-space exploration and [Antimatter]( {{< relref "resource/Antimatter.md" >}}) generation. Strategic advice suggests that if your oil is constantly hitting its cap, you should consider using [Engineers]( {{< relref "job/Engineer.md" >}}) to automate the conversion of oil into Kerosene to ensure your Fracturers never halt production.
