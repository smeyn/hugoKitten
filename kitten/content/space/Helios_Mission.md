The [Helios Mission]( {{< relref "space/Helios_Mission.md" >}}) is a significant mid-to-late game space project that involves launching a rocket to the G2V spectral type star at the centre of the Cath solar system. Completing this mission is a prerequisite for moving further into the star system, specifically unlocking the [Yarn Mission]( {{< relref "space/Yarn_Mission.md" >}}).

### **Mission Requirements and Logistics**
To launch the Helios mission, you must have first successfully completed the [Dune Mission]( {{< relref "space/Dune_Mission.md" >}}). The specific resource requirements are:
*   **Starcharts:** 3,000
*   [Titanium:]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) 15,000
*   [Science:]( {{< relref "resource/science.md" >}}) 250,000
*   [Kerosene:]( {{< relref "resource/kerosene.md" >}}) 1,250

The travel time for the mission is **1,200 game-days**, which equates to approximately **40 minutes** in real-time. This duration can be reduced significantly by researching drive upgrades such as the [Antimatter Drive]( {{< relref "upgrade/Antimatter_Drive.md" >}}) or [Thorium Drive]( {{< relref "upgrade/Thorium_Drive.md" >}}).

### **Unlocked Structures and Infrastructure**
The primary importance of the Helios mission is the gateway it provides to advanced energy and **antimatter production**. Successfully completing the mission unlocks four critical space structures:
*   [Sunlifter:]( {{< relref "space/sunlifter.md" >}}) The primary source of antimatter, producing 1 unit per year while also generating 30 Watts of energy.
*   **Containment Chamber:** Provides base storage for up to 100 units of antimatter, though it consumes 50 Watts of energy.
*   **Heatsink:** Increases the antimatter storage capacity of Containment Chambers by +2%.
*   **Sunforge:** Enhances the storage capacity of base metals (iron, titanium, gold, uranium, and unobtainium) by 1% per building.

### **The Helios Cycle**
If you have researched **Numerology**, the "Helios" cycle (one of ten 5-year cycles in the game) provides specific benefits to your infrastructure. During this cycle:
*   **Sunlifter energy output** is increased by **50%**.
*   **Cryostation storage** is reduced by **10%**.
*   If [Numeromancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/numeromancy.md" >}}) is also researched, holding a festival during the Helios cycle provides **double Faith income** and a **1.25x multiplier to Unicorn income**.

### **Strategic Utility**
The Helios mission marks the transition into the **Relic Era**. To obtain the 5,000 antimatter capacity required for [Relic Stations]( {{< relref "upgrade/Relic_Station.md" >}}), players must typically invest heavily in Helios-based structures, specifically building enough **Heatsinks** (often up to 34 or 37) and **Containment Chambers** to reach the necessary cap. Furthermore, building a Sunlifter is a mandatory goal for completing the **Energy Challenge**.
