The [Outer Space Treaty]( {{< relref "Policy/Outer_Space_Treaty.md" >}}) is a high-tier **Foreign policy** in *Kittens Game* that improves global trade relations by declaring space a domain for all races. It is primarily used to boost the effectiveness of trade with all civilisations once you have reached the space era.

### **Requirements and Costs**
To enact this policy, your civilisation must meet the following criteria:
*   **Cost:** 10,000 Culture.
*   **Prerequisite:** You must have launched at least one **Satellite**.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Choosing this policy permanently locks out the [Militarize Space]( {{< relref "Policy/Militarize_Space.md" >}}) policy for the remainder of your current run.

### **Core Effects**
*   **Global Trade Bonus:** It provides a permanent boost to relations with all trading partners, equivalent to having **10 extra Tradeposts**.
*   **Pacifism Challenge Goal:** Researching this policy and subsequently resetting the game is the primary objective and win condition for the **Pacifism Challenge**.

### **Strategic Comparison**
When choosing between the available space policies, the [Outer Space Treaty]( {{< relref "Policy/Outer_Space_Treaty.md" >}}) is widely considered the superior choice for most playstyles.

| Policy | Primary Benefit | Strategic Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Outer Space Treaty]( {{< relref "Policy/Outer_Space_Treaty.md" >}}) | Better trade relations (+10 Tradeposts). | Generally useful most of the time to resolve resource bottlenecks through trade. |
| [Militarize Space]( {{< relref "Policy/Militarize_Space.md" >}}) | Boosts the science bonus that Satellites provide to Observatories. | Only recommended if your space structures are consistently hitting their science storage caps. |

### **Role in the Endgame**
In the late game, the [Outer Space Treaty]( {{< relref "Policy/Outer_Space_Treaty.md" >}}) serves as a vital component for players focusing on **system arbitrage** and trade efficiency. Because trade is one of the most effective ways to acquire restricted resources like [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) and **Iron** without relying on slower production buildings, the relationship bonus provided by the treaty helps ensure consistent, high-yield exchanges with all discovered races.
