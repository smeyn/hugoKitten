+++
[Order of the Stars]( {{< relref "Policy/Order_of_the_Stars.md" >}}) is a late-game **Government policy** that focuses on accelerating religious progression by increasing **Faith production**. It represents a shift where priests take control of the government after the horrors of deep space are discovered.

### **Core Mechanics and Costs**
*   **Cost:** 150,000 Culture.
*   **Primary Effect:** Provides a **+20% bonus to Faith production**.
*   **Leadership Restriction:** Once enacted, only kittens with the [Priest]( {{< relref "job/Priest.md" >}}) job are allowed to be assigned as the village leader. 
*   **Prerequisites:** You must have **reached Dune** and currently have a kitten assigned to the [Priest]( {{< relref "job/Priest.md" >}}) job.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** This policy is mutually exclusive with [Technocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Technocracy.md" >}}) (+20% science cap) and [Cosmological Libertarianism]( {{< relref "Policy/Cosmological_Libertarianism.md" >}}) (+15% unobtainium production).

### **Strategic Utility**
Choosing Order of the Stars is a highly specific strategic decision depending on your current run goals:

*   **The Religion Grind:** This policy is the ideal choice for runs where your primary objective is to work on **religious bonuses** and grind **Transcendence tiers**. Because faith production is naturally slow, the +20% boost is significant for reaching high tiers like TT15, which is a major gateway for late-game time crystal production.
*   **Leadership Flexibility:** Although the policy restricts leaders to Priests, it is noted in endgame guides that the policy remains effective even if you choose to have **no leader assigned** at all.
*   **Comparison with Alternatives:** 
    *   Most players prefer [Cosmological Libertarianism]( {{< relref "Policy/Cosmological_Libertarianism.md" >}}) because the need for Unobtainium is often more pressing than Faith in the late game.
    *   [Technocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Technocracy.md" >}}) is generally avoided because science storage can be easily increased through other buildings and upgrades, making it less valuable than a production boost.

### **When to Enact**
You should consider [Order of the Stars]( {{< relref "Policy/Order_of_the_Stars.md" >}}) if you have already optimized your Unobtainium production and are now hitting a bottleneck with your **Apocrypha bonus** or trying to break through higher **Transcendence levels** to fuel your Time Crystal engine.
