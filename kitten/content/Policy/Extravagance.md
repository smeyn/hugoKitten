+++
[Extravagance]( {{< relref "Policy/Extravagance.md" >}}) is a mid-game **Philosophy policy** that prioritises kitten morale by significantly increasing the happiness provided by luxury goods, at the cost of consuming those resources much faster.

### **Core Mechanics**
*   **Cost:** 3,500 Culture.
*   **Prerequisites:** You must have previously enacted the **Epicureanism** policy.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Selecting Extravagance permanently locks you out of the [Carnivale]( {{< relref "Policy/Carnivale.md" >}}) policy for the remainder of your current run.

### **Primary Effects**
The policy represents a society "doubling down" on its epicurean ideals, leading to the following mechanical changes:
*   **Enhanced Happiness:** Consumable luxury resources (such as Furs, Ivory, and Spice) provide **5 happiness** each.
*   **Increased Depletion:** Consumable luxury resources are used up **three times as quickly** (indicated as 200% additional consumption).

### **Strategic Advice**
*   **Extravagance vs. Carnivale:** Players often prefer Extravagance when they want to maximise their **"happy%"** bonus to global production. Strategic guides suggest that if your hunting and trading infrastructure is strong enough to maintain a steady supply of luxuries, the faster consumption rate is a worthwhile trade-off for the morale boost.
*   **Mitigation:** To handle the rapid drain of resources, it is recommended to have a robust number of [Tradeposts]( {{< relref "buildings/Tradepost.md" >}}), which help slow down the consumption of rare resources through diminishing returns.
*   **First Run Utility:** On initial runs, some players find [Carnivale]( {{< relref "Policy/Carnivale.md" >}}) (which focuses on kitten arrival speed during festivals) less useful than the raw production boost provided by the higher happiness of Extravagance.
