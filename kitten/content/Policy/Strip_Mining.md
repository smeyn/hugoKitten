[Strip Mining]( {{< relref "Policy/Strip_Mining.md" >}}) is an environmental policy that increases your global **mineral production by 30%**. While it provides a significant boost to raw material output, it introduces negative side effects to your colony's morale and environment.

### **Core Stats and Requirements**
*   **Cost:** 2000 Science.
*   **Prerequisite:** Researching the [Engineering]( {{< relref "techs/Engineering.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Enacting Strip Mining permanently locks out the [Clear Cutting]( {{< relref "Policy/Clear_Cutting.md" >}}) and [Environmentalism]( {{< relref "Policy/Environmentalism.md" >}}) policies for the remainder of the run.
*   **Iron Will Bonus:** In this specialized mode, it grants a **+10% bonus to minerals gathered from meteors**.

### **Trade-offs and Penalties**
Implementing this policy comes with two primary drawbacks:
*   **Happiness Penalty:** It imposes a **-2% penalty** to kitten happiness.
*   **Pollution:** It increases pollution by **+5%**. High levels of pollution can eventually lead to reduced catnip production, lower happiness, and slower kitten arrival speeds.

### **Strategic Advice**
*   **Early-Game Choice:** Most veteran players recommend choosing [Clear Cutting]( {{< relref "Policy/Clear_Cutting.md" >}}) over Strip Mining in early runs. This is because minerals are generally easier to accumulate than wood at that stage, and the wood boost from Clear Cutting is vital for reaching the Navigation era.
*   **Mid-to-Late Game Role:** Despite being less popular early on, Strip Mining (or Clear Cutting) is a mandatory stepping stone to unlock powerful industrial policies like [Full Industrialization]( {{< relref "Policy/Full_Industrialization.md" >}}) or [Sustainability]( {{< relref "Policy/Sustainability.md" >}}) once you research Industrialization.
*   **Unobtainium Production:** In the late game, the [Full Industrialization]( {{< relref "Policy/Full_Industrialization.md" >}}) policy—which requires having purchased Strip Mining or Clear Cutting—is considered essential for maximizing the output of factories and space structures.

### **Advanced Synergies**
*   [Sustainability:]( {{< relref "Policy/Sustainability.md" >}}) Once you reach the industrial era, you can enact the [Sustainability]( {{< relref "Policy/Sustainability.md" >}}) policy to remove the -2% happiness penalty and mitigate the pollution caused by Strip Mining.
*   [Full Industrialization:]( {{< relref "Policy/Full_Industrialization.md" >}}) Alternatively, you can lean into the industrial path, making your factories **5% more powerful** at the cost of even more pollution.

Are you currently hitting a mineral bottleneck that makes this policy look tempting, or are you trying to decide between this and [Clear Cutting]( {{< relref "Policy/Clear_Cutting.md" >}}) for your first industrial push?
