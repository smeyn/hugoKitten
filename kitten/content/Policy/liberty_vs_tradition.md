The choice between the [Liberty]( {{< relref "Policy/Liberty.md" >}}) and [Tradition]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}) Policy/ in *Kittens Game* represents an early decision regarding how your civilization addresses population growth, resource management, and scientific advancement. Both Policy/ become available once you have researched [Writing]( {{< relref "techs/Writing.md" >}}) and both cost **150 Culture**.

This choice is particularly important because once one is selected, the other is locked out, and this initial decision influences the subsequent **Government Policy/** you can pursue.

Here is a comparison of their purpose, effects, and strategic recommendations:

### 1. Tradition Policy

**Purpose and Effects:**

*   **Manuscript Efficiency:** Tradition is described as being "Good for small culture oriented societies". Its primary effect is reducing the cost and increasing the impact of Manuscripts.
    *   **Cost Reduction:** Manuscript cost is reduced by **100 Culture and 5 Parchment**.
    *   **Culture Cap Boost:** It **doubles the manuscript max culture effect**.
*   **Expert Recommendation:** "Monstrous Advice" strongly recommends [Tradition]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}) ("all the way!") because manuscripts are crucial for progression, and making them cheaper and more effective is highly beneficial.

**Progression Path:**

*   Choosing Tradition allows you to later select [Monarchy]( {{< relref "Policy/Monarchy.md" >}}) or [Autocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Autocracy.md" >}}) (both costing 1500 Culture).

### 2. Liberty Policy

**Purpose and Effects:**

*   **Happiness Focus:** Liberty is intended for societies focused on happiness, addressing the natural unhappiness that arises from increasing population.
    *   **Happiness Bonus:** It **increases the production effect of happiness by 10%**.
    *   **Population Bonus:** It **adds free housing for one kitten**.
*   **Contextual Use:** In early runs, the Liberty policy can be obtained to offset a "big production hit due to happiness".

**Strategic Critique:**

*   "Monstrous Advice" labels Liberty as a **"noob trap"** because it promises to solve a problem (low happiness/production) that can often be managed through other means, such as accumulating Karma from resets or building Amphitheatres.
*   The "Kittensgame starter guide," however, suggests that in early runs, if progression is slowing due to low happiness/high population penalty, obtaining Liberty can be useful to mitigate that production hit. However, in later runs (once Karma is acquired), switching to Tradition may be preferable.

**Progression Path:**

*   Choosing Liberty allows you to later select [Republic]( {{< relref "Policy/Republic.md" >}}) or [Autocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Autocracy.md" >}}) (both costing 1500 Culture).

### Summary of Differences

| Policy | Primary Benefit | Recommended Strategy | Subsequent Governments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Tradition]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}) | **Reduces the cost of manuscripts** and increases their culture effect. | Highly recommended by experts for improving long-term progress and managing the manuscript bottleneck. | Monarchy, Autocracy. |
| [Liberty]( {{< relref "Policy/Liberty.md" >}}) | Increases kitten production based on Happiness and provides one free housing unit. | Useful in specific early runs if happiness penalties are severely impacting production. | Republic, Autocracy. |

**In essence, Tradition invests in the efficiency of your scientific engine (Manuscript production), while Liberty attempts to mask the symptoms of low kitten Happiness to maintain production.** For most players seeking rapid progress, the permanent resource efficiency gained from [Tradition]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}) is favored, as manuscripts quickly become a bottleneck required for advanced technologies like Theology and Astronomy.
