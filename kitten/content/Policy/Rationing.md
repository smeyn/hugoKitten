[Rationing]( {{< relref "Policy/Rationing.md" >}}) is a mid-game **Philosophy policy** in *Kittens Game* designed to mitigate the food-related "cost of happiness" and provide a minor boost to hunting effectiveness. It is particularly useful when your civilisation reaches high happiness levels that would otherwise cause your kittens to consume catnip at an unsustainable rate.

### **Policy Overview**
*   **Cost:** 3,500 Culture.
*   **Prerequisite:** [Stoicism]( {{< relref "Policy/Stoicism.md" >}}) policy.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Enacting Rationing permanently locks out the [Frugality]( {{< relref "Policy/Frugality.md" >}}) policy for the remainder of the run.

### **Core Effects**
| Effect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Catnip Efficiency** | Reduces the catnip consumption increase caused by high happiness by **10%**. |
| **Hunting Bonus** | Provides a flat **+0.1 bonus** to all hunting activities. |

### **Strategic Utility**
The primary value of Rationing lies in managing the **Resource/Consumption Equilibrium** as your village matures.

*   **Mitigating the Happiness Liability:** While high happiness is essential for scaling production, it also causes kittens to eat significantly more catnip. For example, at **420% happiness**, kittens consume **320% more catnip** than their base rate. Rationing acts as a safety valve, ensuring that a sudden spike in morale does not lead to a catastrophic food shortage or mass starvation during Winter.
*   **Hunting Support:** The **+0.1 hunting bonus** is a helpful, albeit minor, addition to your passive or active hunting teams, increasing the yield of **Furs and Ivory** used for crafting parchment and manuscripts.
*   **Choosing Between Branches:** Because this policy is locked behind Stoicism, you have already committed to a path of restraint over the **Epicureanism** branch. Within the Stoicism branch, you must choose between Rationing (food and hunting) or [Frugality]( {{< relref "Policy/Frugality.md" >}}) (which boosts [Mint]( {{< relref "buildings/Mint.md" >}}) production by 10%). 

In some strategic guides, Rationing is viewed as a situational choice; if you have a robust hunting team and sufficient [Tradeposts]( {{< relref "buildings/Tradepost.md" >}}) to manage luxury consumption, the benefits of Rationing or Frugality may feel minor compared to high-tier industrial or scientific policies.

Are you currently facing a catnip deficit due to high happiness, or are you comparing this to the [Frugality]( {{< relref "Policy/Frugality.md" >}}) policy to see which better fits your current gold and ivory production goals?
