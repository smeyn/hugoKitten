[Liberalism]( {{< relref "Policy/Liberalism.md" >}}) is a mid-to-late game Government policy in *Kittens Game* that represents a "peaceful and open society". It is primarily designed to enhance economic efficiency through trade and cost reduction.

### **Core Mechanics**
*   **Cost:** 15,000 Culture.
*   **Primary Effects:** 
    *   **Enhanced Trade Relations:** Provides a bonus to all trade partners equivalent to having **10 extra Tradeposts**.
    *   **Gold Discount:** Reduces all gold costs throughout the game by **20%**.
*   **Prerequisites:** You must have built at least one [Factory]( {{< relref "buildings/Factory.md" >}}) and previously enacted either the [Monarchy]( {{< relref "Policy/Monarchy.md" >}}) or [Republic]( {{< relref "Policy/Republic.md" >}}) policy.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Choosing Liberalism permanently locks you out of [Communism]( {{< relref "Policy/Communism.md" >}}) and [Fascism]( {{< relref "Policy/Fascism.md" >}}) for the remainder of your current run.

### **Strategic Utility**
Liberalism is generally selected to resolve specific diplomatic or resource bottlenecks:

*   **Mitigating Zebra Hostility:** It is highly recommended if you are struggling with Zebra hostility, as the relationship bonus makes trades more reliable and productive.
*   **Boosting Catpower and Ivory:** Strategic guides suggest Liberalism is excellent for long runs because it allows for more **Templar upgrades**. These upgrades increase your maximum **catpower cap**, which in turn assists with ivory generation and large-scale trading.
*   **Gold Scarcity:** The 20% discount on all gold costs is a significant advantage if gold production is your primary bottleneck for building expansion or promoting leaders.

### **The Ideological Path**
Liberalism is the final stage of the "Liberty" branch of the policy tree:
**Liberty $\to$ Republic $\to$ Liberalism**.

In contrast, if you have already negated Zebra hostility through other means (such as having a high number of Tradeposts or the Caravanserai upgrade), many players prefer [Communism]( {{< relref "Policy/Communism.md" >}}) for its +25% boost to iron, coal, and titanium production.

Are you currently finding gold to be a major bottleneck for your buildings, or are you looking to maximise your **Templar upgrades** to push your catpower limits higher?
