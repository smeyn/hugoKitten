The policy [Fascism]( {{< relref "Policy/Fascism.md" >}}) is an advanced Government policy in *Kittens Game*, primarily focused on aggressively boosting population by reducing housing costs and eliminating population-related happiness penalties.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the Fascism policy:

### Policy Details and Effects

| Category | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | **15,000 Culture**. |
| **Description** | The policy's description is **"Lebensraum!"**. |
| **Prerequisites** | You must **Build a factory** and have previously chosen [Autocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Autocracy.md" >}}) or [Monarchy]( {{< relref "Policy/Monarchy.md" >}}). |
| **Locks** | Choosing Fascism locks out both the [Communism]( {{< relref "Policy/Communism.md" >}}) and [Liberalism]( {{< relref "Policy/Liberalism.md" >}}) Policy/. |
| **Key Effects** | **Log cabins are 50% cheaper**. Log Houses are the housing structure that follows Huts. |
| | **Eliminates population penalties to happiness**. |

### Strategic Evaluation

Fascism is one of three major government policy choices (Liberalism, Fascism, or Communism) available after meeting the Factory prerequisite.

*   **First Run Population Push:** This policy is strategically useful on the **first run**. The main goal of the initial run is often to accumulate sufficient population to gain Paragon upon reset. You might select Fascism for a couple of extra [log houses]( {{< relref "buildings/Log_House.md" >}}) to help reach **130+ kittens before the first reset**.
*   **Population Boost:** The policy gives a nice population boost because the reduced cost of log cabins makes expanding housing capacity easier.
*   **Happiness Management:** By eliminating population penalties to happiness, it allows players to grow their workforce faster without suffering the associated production drop caused by unhappiness.
*   **Policy Alternatives:** In later runs, Policy/ that offer long-term industrial boosts or trade relations are often prioritized:
    *   [Liberalism]( {{< relref "Policy/Liberalism.md" >}}) may be preferred if you are struggling with **zebra hostility** (which impacts titanium acquisition).
    *   [Communism]( {{< relref "Policy/Communism.md" >}}) may be preferred if zebra hostility has been negated, as it provides a strong boost to **industry** (+25% iron, coal, and titanium production). Communism is also suggested to give better time crystal results in self-imposed restriction runs.
*   **Paragon Scaling:** As your Paragon grows, the Fascism policy can be unlocked to aid in population growth.
