+++
In *Kittens Game*, the [Big Stick Policy]( {{< relref "Policy/Big_Stick_Policy.md" >}}) is a mid-game **Foreign policy** that makes building **Embassies cheaper**. It is part of the isolationist branch of the policy tree and is designed to help players reach higher embassy levels with other civilisations more efficiently.

### **Mechanics and Costs**
*   **Effect:** Reduces the cost of all **Embassies by 15%**.
*   **Cost:** 4,000 Culture.
*   **Prerequisites:** You must have researched [Astronomy]( {{< relref "techs/Astronomy.md" >}}) and enacted the [Isolationism]( {{< relref "Policy/Isolationism.md" >}}) policy.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Choosing this policy permanently locks out the [City On A Hill]( {{< relref "Policy/City_On_A_Hill.md" >}}) policy for the remainder of the run.

### **Strategic Utility**
While often regarded as a niche choice, the Big Stick Policy has specific applications depending on your current goals:

*   **Naga Trade Synergies:** This policy is often preferred over its counterparts when players are focused on **Naga exchanges**. Because Nagas provide minerals in exchange for ivory, reaching the embassy thresholds required to unlock rare Naga resources (like slabs or blueprints) is easier with cheaper building costs.
*   **Comparative Value:** Strategic advice suggests that while both Big Stick Policy and City On A Hill are relatively weak compared to late-game options, Big Stick Policy is generally considered to have **more practical usefulness** because it provides a tangible resource discount.
*   **Discovery Path:** It sits opposite the **Diplomacy -> Cultural Exchange** path. If you choose the Isolationism route, you are prioritising lower trade gold costs and cheaper embassies over the catpower discounts and culture boosts found in the Diplomacy route.

### **Context in the Policy Tree**
The Big Stick Policy represents a "speak softly but carry a big stick" philosophy, focusing on using your military or economic weight to organise your relationships with the other races of Cath. In the long term, most players eventually transition toward policies like [Outer Space Treaty]( {{< relref "Policy/Outer_Space_Treaty.md" >}}) or more advanced government forms as they move into the space and eludium eras.

Are you currently pursuing a specific trade goal, such as increasing your **Naga embassy levels** for blueprints, or are you looking for a way to manage your **culture cap** instead?
