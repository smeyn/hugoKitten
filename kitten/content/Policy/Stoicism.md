[Stoicism]( {{< relref "Policy/Stoicism.md" >}}) is a mid-game **Philosophy policy** that focuses on resource preservation by significantly reducing the consumption rate of luxury goods. It is primarily used to maintain high kitten happiness and trade liquidity when rare resource production is low.

### **Core Mechanics**
*   **Cost:** 2,500 Culture.
*   **Prerequisites:** You must have researched the [Philosophy]( {{< relref "science/Philosophy.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Enacting Stoicism permanently locks you out of the **Epicureanism** policy for the remainder of the run.

### **Primary Effects**
The policy encourages restraint within your feline society, leading to the following benefits:
*   **Luxury Preservation:** Reduces the consumption of **Furs, Ivory, and Spice** by **50%**.
*   **Brewery Efficiency:** Reduces brewery consumption by **25%**.

### **The Stoicism Policy Branch**
Choosing Stoicism unlocks a specific path of follow-up policies focused on efficiency and restraint:
*   [Frugality:]( {{< relref "Policy/Frugality.md" >}}) Increases [Mint]( {{< relref "buildings/Mint.md" >}}) production by **10%** by reducing corruption.
*   [Rationing:]( {{< relref "Policy/Rationing.md" >}}) Reduces the catnip consumption penalty from high happiness by **10%** and provides a **+0.1 Hunting bonus**.

### **Strategic Advice**
*   **Stoicism vs. Epicureanism:** This is a common choice for players. While **Epicureanism** increases the happiness bonus provided by rare resources (from 10% to 11%), [Stoicism]( {{< relref "Policy/Stoicism.md" >}}) ensures your limited stock of those resources lasts twice as long. 
*   **Early Game Utility:** Some guides suggest that Stoicism is less necessary if you have a robust hunting team and many [Tradeposts]( {{< relref "buildings/Tradepost.md" >}}), as these already slow down luxury consumption. 
*   **Iron Will Context:** In specialized modes where resources like [Ivory]( {{< relref "resource/ivory.md" >}}) are harder to come by and essential for trade (such as trading with the Nagas), Stoicism can be a vital tool for maintaining your progress.
