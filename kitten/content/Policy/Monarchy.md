+++
[Monarchy]( {{< relref "Policy/Monarchy.md" >}}) is a mid-game Government policy that significantly amplifies the utility of your civilisation's leader. It is generally considered the most effective choice in its tier because it **doubles the effectiveness of the leader's unique trait**, providing a flexible bonus that you can swap as your needs change.

### **Core Mechanics**
*   **Cost:** 1,500 Culture.
*   **Prerequisites:** You must have researched [Writing]( {{< relref "techs/Writing.md" >}}) and enacted the [Tradition]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}) policy.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Choosing Monarchy permanently locks out the [Autocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Autocracy.md" >}}) and [Republic]( {{< relref "Policy/Republic.md" >}}) policies for the remainder of that run.
*   **The Gold Penalty:** Maintaining the royal court imposes a **-10% penalty** to your overall gold production.

### **Trait Doubling Effects**
The primary draw of Monarchy is its interaction with kitten traits. When a kitten is assigned as the leader, their trait becomes twice as powerful. Common synergies include:

*   **Artisan Leader:** Boosts crafting efficiency. Under Monarchy, the bonus increases from 5% to **10%**.
*   **Scientist Leader:** Reduces the science cost of technologies and workshop upgrades. Under Monarchy, the discount is doubled.
*   **Philosopher Leader:** Reduces the faith and gold costs for the **Order of the Sun**.

### **Strategic Comparison: Monarchy vs. Republic**
As discussed previously with other policies, choosing between the government branches depends on your current population and goals.

| Feature | Monarchy | Republic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prerequisite** | [Tradition]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}) (Culture-focused) | [Liberty]( {{< relref "Policy/Liberty.md" >}}) (Happiness-focused) |
| **Primary Effect** | **Doubles** the leader's specific trait | Small production boost to **all** kittens |
| **Penalty** | -10% Gold production | None |
| **Expert Verdict** | Often called **"Amazing"** due to its high flexibility. | Bonuses are often considered too small compared to Monarchy. |

### **Advanced Synergy: The "11 Kitten" Bonus**
The strength of Monarchy scales with your leader's rank. You can use gold and experience to **promote your leader** up to five times. A high-ranking Artisan leader under a Monarchy is so efficient that it provides a crafting boost equivalent to having **11 extra kittens** assigned to that resource.

Because you can swap leaders at any time without a penalty, Monarchy allows you to adapt to your current bottleneck—switching to a Scientist when researching expensive tech like [Theology]( {{< relref "science/Theology.md" >}}), or an Artisan when mass-producing [Manuscripts]( {{< relref "resource/manuscript.md" >}}) or [Compendiums]( {{< relref "resource/Compendium.md" >}}).
