[Rationality]( {{< relref "Policy/Rationality.md" >}}) is a mid-game **Philosophy policy** in *Kittens Game* that provides a modest boost to scientific and industrial production. It represents the societal view that the world can be fundamentally understood through logic and reason.

### **Core Effects and Costs**
*   **Effect**: Increases both **Science and Iron production by 5%**.
*   **Cost**: 3000 Science.
*   **Prerequisites**: You must have researched the [Philosophy]( {{< relref "science/Philosophy.md" >}}) technology and enacted either the [Stoicism]( {{< relref "Policy/Stoicism.md" >}}) or **Epicureanism** policy.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity**: Choosing Rationality permanently locks you out of the [Mysticism]( {{< relref "Policy/Mysticism.md" >}}) policy for the remainder of the run.

### **Strategic Comparison: Rationality vs. Mysticism**
Because these policies are mutually exclusive, you must choose between boosting Science/Iron or Culture/Faith.

| Policy | Production Bonuses | Strategic Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Rationality]( {{< relref "Policy/Rationality.md" >}}) | **+5% Science**, **+5% Iron** | Focuses on technical and industrial throughput. |
| [Mysticism]( {{< relref "Policy/Mysticism.md" >}}) | **+5% Culture**, **+5% Faith** | Focuses on religious and cultural scaling. |

### **Expert Recommendation**
Strategic guides generally recommend choosing **Mysticism over Rationality** for the following reasons:
*   **Science is "Easy":** Science production and storage are relatively easy to manage through buildings like Libraries, Academies, and Observatories.
*   **Culture/Faith Bottlenecks:** Culture and Faith accumulate much more slowly, especially in the early-to-mid game, making percentage bonuses for these resources far more valuable. 
*   **Iron Scaling:** While a 5% Iron boost is helpful, industrial production is often better scaled through [Workshops]( {{< relref "buildings/Workshop.md" >}}), [Smelters]( {{< relref "buildings/Smelter.md" >}}), and [Calciners]( {{< relref "buildings/Calciner.md" >}}) rather than a dedicated philosophy policy.

Are you currently hitting a specific Science cap that makes the 5% boost tempting, or are you looking to optimize your [Faith]( {{< relref "resource/faith.md" >}}) production for religious upgrades?
