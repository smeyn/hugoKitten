[Spiders]( {{< relref "trade/spiders.md" >}}) are a friendly trade partner in *Kittens Game* that players typically encounter in the mid-to-late game. They are a valuable source for acquiring [Coal]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}) and **Oil**, which can help resolve industrial bottlenecks when production from Smelters or Geologists is insufficient.

### **Discovery and Unlock Requirements**
Because of their steep requirements, Spiders are considered "waayyyy off" for early-game players. You can discover them by **Sending Explorers** (costing 1,000 catpower) only once you have achieved the following:
*   **125,000 Max Science** capacity.
*   At least **100 Trade Ships**.

### **Trade Mechanics**
The Spiders have a **Friendly** attitude, which grants a baseline **+15% bonus** to trade rewards. Their primary trade involves purchasing [Scaffolds]( {{< relref "craft/Scaffold.md" >}}) from you.

| Action | Resource | Base Amount | Chance | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **They Buy** | Scaffolds | 50 | 100% | N/A |
| **They Sell** | [Coal]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}) | 350 | 100% | N/A |
| **They Sell** | **Oil** | 100 | 25% | **Embassy Level 5** |

### **Seasonal Strategy**
Like most trade partners, the Spiders' resource yields are affected by the current season. To maximise your [Coal]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}) returns, you should focus your trading during **Autumn**.

*   **Spring:** +0% (Standard).
*   **Summer:** +5% bonus.
*   **Autumn:** **+15% bonus** (Optimal for trading).
*   **Winter:** -5% penalty.

### **Strategic Utility**
While trading Scaffolds for Coal is not always realistic in the early game due to the high cost of Scaffolds, it becomes a viable strategy later on. Spiders are particularly useful for:
*   **Automated Coal Gains:** They provide an alternative to the Geologist job or Smelter upgrades like the Coal Furnace.
*   **Oil Acquisition:** For players who have reached the **Titanium/Space eras**, Spiders offer a way to supplement Oil production alongside Oil Wells and Bio Labs.
*   **Diplomacy Synergy:** If you have the [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "Policy/Diplomacy.md" >}}) Metaphysics upgrade, you can further improve your standing and trade efficiency with the Spiders, though they are already friendly by default.

Are you currently working toward the 125,000 science cap to unlock them, or are you looking for a more immediate way to solve a coal shortage?
