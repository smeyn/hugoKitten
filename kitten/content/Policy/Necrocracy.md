[Necrocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Necrocracy.md" >}}) is an endgame **Government policy** that provides a global production bonus based on your accumulated **Black Liquid Sorrow (BLS)** and increases the energy capacity of Leviathans. It represents a society that has offered itself to the "Elders" (Leviathans), trading kittenhood for dark industrial efficiency.

### **Core Statistics and Requirements**

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Culture Cost** | 1,500,000 |
| **Prerequisite** | Must have made at least one **trade with the Leviathans** |
| **Primary Effect** | **Global production bonus:** 0.1% for every 1% of Black Liquid Sorrow (BLS) |
| **Secondary Effect** | **Leviathan Energy Cap Boost:** +5% |
| **Mutual Exclusivity** | Locks out [Transkittenism]( {{< relref "Policy/Transkittenism.md" >}}) and [Radical Xenophobia]( {{< relref "Policy/Radical_Xenophobia.md" >}}) |

### **Strategic Utility**
Necrocracy is considered a niche but powerful choice for players in the deep **Late Game** or **End Game** phases.

*   **Production Scaling:** The primary draw is the production bonus tied to BLS. In the late game, players accumulate BLS through **Unicorn Tears** or trading, and buildings like [Black Cores]( {{< relref "transcendence/Black_Core.md" >}}) can increase the BLS limit.
*   **Leviathan Energy:** The 5% boost to the **Leviathan Energy Cap** allows these elders to stay longer and provide better trade ratios when fed necrocorns.
*   **The "Paragon" Threshold:** Strategic advice suggests that Necrocracy’s production bonus requires a significant amount of [Paragon]( {{< relref "resource/paragon.md" >}}) to effectively outcompete the utility of alternative policies.

### **Comparison with Alternatives**
Because this policy is mutually exclusive with two other high-tier options, your choice depends on your current bottleneck:

*   **Vs. Transkittenism:** Transkittenism is generally preferred by many players because it prevents the **AI Apocalypse** and doubles **Gigaflop** production, which is essential for scaling **Moon Base** storage.
*   **Vs. Radical Xenophobia:** Radical Xenophobia focuses on [Mausoleums]( {{< relref "transcendence/Mausoleum.md" >}}) and **Pacts**. Necrocracy is usually seen as more generally useful for raw production compared to the "steep debt" associated with Pact-based play.

### **Strategic Recommendation**
Most expert advice suggests holding off on enacting any of these three policies as long as possible. If your primary goal is to maximise raw output and you have a massive stockpile of **Black Liquid Sorrow**, Necrocracy is the superior choice for production. However, if you are struggling with energy or science caps, [Transkittenism]( {{< relref "Policy/Transkittenism.md" >}}) is often the more practical route.
