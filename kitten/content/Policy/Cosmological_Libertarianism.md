[Cosmological Libertarianism]( {{< relref "Policy/Cosmological_Libertarianism.md" >}}) is an endgame government policy that increases your global **unobtainium production by 15%**. It represents a shift towards privatising space resources to accelerate the expansion of your kitten civilisation beyond the home planet.

### **Policy Overview**
*   **Cost:** 150,000 Culture.
*   **Prerequisite:** Your civilisation must have reached [Dune]( {{< relref "planet/Dune.md" >}}).
*   **Primary Effect:** A global **+15% multiplier** to all unobtainium production.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Enacting this policy permanently locks out [Technocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Technocracy.md" >}}) and [Order of the Stars]( {{< relref "Policy/Order_of_the_Stars.md" >}}) for the remainder of the run.

### **Strategic Comparison**
In the late game, players must choose one of three mutually exclusive policies. Cosmological Libertarianism is widely considered the superior choice for general progression.

| Policy | Effect | Strategic Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Cosmological Libertarianism]( {{< relref "Policy/Cosmological_Libertarianism.md" >}}) | **+15% Unobtainium production** | **High.** Unobtainium is the primary bottleneck for advanced space missions and Chronospheres. |
| [Order of the Stars]( {{< relref "Policy/Order_of_the_Stars.md" >}}) | **+20% Faith production** | **Situational.** Only recommended if your sole goal is grinding religion bonuses or Transcendence tiers. |
| [Technocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Technocracy.md" >}}) | **+20% Science cap** | **Low.** Science storage is generally easy to manage via buildings like Data Centres and Bio Labs. |

### **The Unobtainium Bottleneck**
Unobtainium is essential for crafting [Eludium]( {{< relref "resource/eludium.md" >}}) and building [Chronospheres]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}), which are required for self-sustaining "positive resets". Because unobtainium production is significantly slower than most other base resources, the 15% boost from Cosmological Libertarianism provides a massive advantage in scaling your civilisation's temporal and space-faring capabilities.

### **Mathematical Impact**
The bonus from this policy is applied multiplicatively in the unobtainium production formula, stacking with other modifiers such as:
*   **Space Elevators and Orbital Arrays**.
*   [Microwarp Reactors]( {{< relref "upgrade/Microwarp_Reactors.md" >}}).
*   [Redmoon Cycle]( {{< relref "Cycles/Redmoon_cycle.md" >}}) effects (if Numerology is researched).
