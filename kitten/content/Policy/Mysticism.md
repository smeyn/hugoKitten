[Mysticism]( {{< relref "Policy/Mysticism.md" >}}) is a mid-game **Philosophy policy** that provides a global bonus to your **Culture and Faith production**. It represents a societal shift towards acknowledging forces beyond feline comprehension, prioritising spiritual and artistic growth over pure logic.

### **Key Statistics**
*   **Cost:** 3,000 Culture.
*   **Primary Effects:** **+5% Culture production** and **+5% Faith production**.
*   **Prerequisites:** Researching the [Philosophy]( {{< relref "science/Philosophy.md" >}}) technology and enacting either the [Stoicism]( {{< relref "Policy/Stoicism.md" >}}) or **Epicureanism** policy.
*   **Mutually Exclusive:** Choosing Mysticism permanently locks you out of the [Rationality]( {{< relref "Policy/Rationality.md" >}}) policy for the remainder of the run.

### **Strategic Utility**
In the *Kittens Game* community, Mysticism is almost universally recommended over its counterpart, Rationality. 

*   **The Resource Bottleneck:** Faith and culture are considered "slow" resources that are often difficult to accumulate in large quantities during the mid-game. 
*   **Science Overabundance:** The alternative policy, Rationality, provides a bonus to science and iron. However, science is generally viewed as "easy" to acquire through buildings like Libraries, Academies, and Observatories, making a percentage bonus less impactful.
*   **Religious Engine:** The +5% Faith bonus is particularly valuable for accelerating your progress through the **Order of the Sun** upgrades, helping you reach the [Solar Revolution]( {{< relref "religion/Solar_Revolution.md" >}}) production cap more efficiently.

### **Strategic Recommendation**
Most experienced players follow the **Stoicism -> Mysticism** path. While a 5% increase might seem minor, the fact that it targets two of the most persistent mid-game bottlenecks makes it the "meta" choice for standard runs.
