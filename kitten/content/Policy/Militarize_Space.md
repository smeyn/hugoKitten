[Militarize Space]( {{< relref "Policy/Militarize_Space.md" >}}) is a late-game **Foreign policy** that focuses on aggressive scientific research to expand your knowledge limits. It specifically enhances the synergy between your orbital infrastructure and ground-based research buildings.

### **Core Effects and Requirements**
*   **Cost:** 10,000 Culture.
*   **Prerequisite:** You must have successfully launched at least one **Satellite**.
*   **Scientific Bonus:** It makes the **Satellite science bonus** to Observatories **10% more powerful**. 
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Choosing this policy permanently locks you out of the [Outer Space Treaty]( {{< relref "Policy/Outer_Space_Treaty.md" >}}) for the remainder of your current run.

### **Strategic Analysis: Militarize Space vs. Outer Space Treaty**
Deciding between these two policies depends on whether your current bottleneck is **Science storage** or **Trade efficiency**.

| Policy | Primary Benefit | Best Used When... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Militarize Space]( {{< relref "Policy/Militarize_Space.md" >}}) | Increases maximum **Science storage** via Satellites. | All your space structures and ground buildings are consistently hitting their **science caps**. |
| [Outer Space Treaty]( {{< relref "Policy/Outer_Space_Treaty.md" >}}) | Improves trade relations with all races (equivalent to **10 Tradeposts**). | You need to maximize trade yields (especially for [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) or [Unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}})). |

### **Expert Recommendation**
In most standard playstyles, [Outer Space Treaty]( {{< relref "Policy/Outer_Space_Treaty.md" >}}) is considered the superior choice because trade remains a vital part of resource acquisition even in the late game. Science storage can often be expanded through other means—such as building more [Data Centers]( {{< relref "buildings/Data_Center.md" >}}), [Bio Labs]( {{< relref "buildings/Bio_Lab.md" >}}), or **Research Vessels**—without sacrificing a policy slot.

However, if you are deep into the space era and find that your science limit is preventing you from researching the next multi-million science technology (like [Exophysics]( {{< relref "techs/Exophysics.md" >}}) or [Quantum Cryptography]( {{< relref "techs/Quantum_Cryptography.md" >}})), Militarize Space can provide that final necessary push.
