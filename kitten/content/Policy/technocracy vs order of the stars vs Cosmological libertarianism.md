[Technocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Technocracy.md" >}}), [Order of the Stars]( {{< relref "Policy/Order_of_the_Stars.md" >}}), and [Cosmological Libertarianism]( {{< relref "Policy/Cosmological_Libertarianism.md" >}}) are mutually exclusive high-tier government Policy/ unlocked in the Science tab once you reach [Dune]( {{< relref "planet/Dune.md" >}}). Each costs **150,000 Culture** and forces you to choose between prioritising science capacity, faith production, or the generation of the critical late-game resource, unobtainium.

### **Comparison of Dune-Tier Policy/**

| Policy | Effect | Key Prerequisite | Strategic Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Cosmological Libertarianism]( {{< relref "Policy/Cosmological_Libertarianism.md" >}}) | **+15% Unobtainium production** | Reach Dune | General progression and overcoming the **unobtainium bottleneck**. |
| [Order of the Stars]( {{< relref "Policy/Order_of_the_Stars.md" >}}) | **+20% Faith production**; leaders must be Priests | Reach Dune + assigned Priest leader | Religious-focused runs and grinding **Transcendence tiers**. |
| [Technocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Technocracy.md" >}}) | **+20% Science cap** | Reach Dune | Reaching massive science thresholds for high-tier technologies. |

### **Strategic Deep Dive**

#### **1. Cosmological Libertarianism (The "Meta" Choice)**
This is widely considered the strongest option for most players. 
*   **Unobtainium is King:** Unobtainium is the primary bottleneck for advanced space missions and time manipulation. A **15% boost** to its production is significant because few other modifiers affect it directly.
*   **Efficiency:** Strategic guides recommend this over the others because "you REALLY need more unob" to progress through Phase 4 and establish a positive reset loop.

#### **2. Order of the Stars (The Religious Choice)**
This policy shifts your government's focus to the heavens and the **Order of the Sun**.
*   **Faith Grinding:** It is most useful during long runs where your primary goal is increasing your [epiphany]( {{< relref "religion/epiphany.md" >}}) and religion bonuses.
*   **Leader Restriction:** Note that while it provides a 20% faith boost, it mandates that only [Priests]( {{< relref "job/Priest.md" >}}) can be assigned as leaders. However, the policy bonus itself still functions even if you do not have an active leader assigned.

#### **3. Technocracy (The Niche Choice)**
Technocracy provides a flat **20% increase to your Science storage capacity**.
*   **Redundancy:** Strategy guides often label Technocracy as unnecessary because players have numerous other options to expand science storage—such as [Compendiums]( {{< relref "resource/Compendium.md" >}}), **Observatories**, and [Data Centers]( {{< relref "buildings/Data_Center.md" >}})—making a policy slot for science cap a lower priority.
*   **Specific Utility:** It is only truly beneficial if you are struggling to hit a specific, massive science threshold for a high-tier technology that other storage buildings cannot reach.

### **Choosing the Right Path**
Because these Policy/ are mutually exclusive, selecting one will **permanently lock** the other two for the remainder of your current run. 

*   **For most runs:** Choose [Cosmological Libertarianism]( {{< relref "Policy/Cosmological_Libertarianism.md" >}}) to speed up the acquisition of time crystals and eludium.
*   **For deep-endgame/40k runs:** You might consider [Order of the Stars]( {{< relref "Policy/Order_of_the_Stars.md" >}}) if your unobtainium production is already self-sustaining and you wish to focus purely on religious scaling.

Do you have a specific goal for your current run, such as farming Paragon or pushing for the 40k achievement? This could help determine which of these three would serve you best right now.
