+++
**Epicureanism** is a mid-game **Philosophy policy** in *Kittens Game* that focuses on maximising kitten morale by increasing the happiness bonus provided by rare luxury resources.

### **Core Mechanics**
*   **Cost:** 2,500 Culture.
*   **Prerequisite:** Researching the [Philosophy]( {{< relref "science/Philosophy.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Primary Effect:** Rare luxury resources (such as Furs, Ivory, and Spice) provide **11% happiness each**, rather than the base 10%.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Choosing Epicureanism permanently locks out the [Stoicism]( {{< relref "Policy/Stoicism.md" >}}) policy for the remainder of the run.

### **Strategic Utility: Epicureanism vs. Stoicism**
In the *Kittens Game* community, Epicureanism is generally preferred over Stoicism for several reasons:
*   **Production Scaling:** Higher happiness directly translates to a global production bonus for all kitten jobs. By increasing the value of each luxury, you can significantly boost your village's overall output.
*   **Luxury Availability:** By the time you can afford this policy, your hunting team and [Tradeposts]( {{< relref "buildings/Tradepost.md" >}}) should be established enough to maintain a steady supply of luxuries.
*   **Consumption Management:** While Stoicism reduces luxury consumption by 50%, most players find that having enough [Tradeposts]( {{< relref "buildings/Tradepost.md" >}}) provides sufficient diminishing returns on consumption to make the extra happiness from Epicureanism worth the cost.

### **Policy Branching**
Enacting Epicureanism is the gateway to the "pleasure-focused" branch of the philosophy tree, eventually allowing you to choose between:
*   [Extravagance:]( {{< relref "Policy/Extravagance.md" >}}) Increases happiness from consumable luxuries to 5, but triples their consumption rate.
*   [Carnivale:]( {{< relref "Policy/Carnivale.md" >}}) Boosts kitten arrival speed and festival growth.

### **Comparison Table**
| Feature | **Epicureanism** | [Stoicism]( {{< relref "Policy/Stoicism.md" >}}) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Philosophy]( {{< relref "science/Philosophy.md" >}}) | "Pleasure is the highest good." | "Endure hardship without complaint." |
| **Main Bonus** | **+11% happiness** per luxury. | **-50% consumption** of luxuries. |
| **Secondary Effect** | Unlocks Extravagance/Carnivale. | Unlocks Rationing/Frugality. |
| **Expert Verdict** | Often the **standard choice** for the "happy%" bonus. | Situational; used if luxuries are scarce. |
