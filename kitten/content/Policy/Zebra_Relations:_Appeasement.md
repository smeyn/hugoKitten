+++
**Zebra Relations: Appeasement** is a mid-game Foreign policy used to improve trade efficiency with the notoriously hostile Zebra race. It is specifically designed to overcome the **titanium bottleneck** by making Zebras more likely to trade and increasing the amount of titanium they provide, though it comes at the cost of a permanent penalty to your gold production.

### **Costs and Effects**
*   **Cost:** 5,000 Culture.
*   **Prerequisite:** You must have met the Zebras (discovered after building your first Trade Ship).
*   **Improved Standing:** It provides a relationship boost equivalent to having **15 extra Tradeposts**, making the Zebras significantly less hostile.
*   **Titanium Bonus:** It adds a multiplicative bonus to the titanium trade ratio, also equivalent to **15 Tradeposts**.
*   **Gold Penalty:** It imposes a **-5% penalty** to your overall gold income.

### **Strategic Utility**
Because Zebras are naturally hostile (-30% attitude), they frequently refuse to trade, which can stall progress during the "Titanium Era".

*   **The Titanium Solution:** Most strategy guides suggest that choosing Appeasement is "not even a question" because players are usually desperate for titanium. Until you have enough Tradeposts to negate Zebra hostility naturally—which requires **85 Tradeposts** (or **58** if you have the [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "Policy/Diplomacy.md" >}}) metaphysics upgrade)—Appeasement is the most effective way to secure a steady supply of metal.
*   **Managing the Gold Penalty:** While gold is a critical resource for trading and religious upgrades, the -5% penalty is generally considered a fair trade-off for the increased titanium velocity. Once your gold production is bolstered by Smelters and the [Geodesy]( {{< relref "upgrade/Geodesy.md" >}}) upgrade, this penalty becomes negligible.

### **Comparison: Appeasement vs. Bellicosity**
Enacting Appeasement permanently locks you out of the **Zebra Relations: Bellicosity** policy for the remainder of that run.

| Policy | Effect on Zebras | Effect on Other Races | Economic Penalty |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Appeasement** | **Improved relations** (+15 Tradeposts) | None | -5% Gold Income |
| **Bellicosity** | **Worse relations** (-10 Tradeposts) | Better relations (+5 Tradeposts) | None |

**Pro Tip:** Expert players generally advise staying with **Appeasement** until your infrastructure (specifically your Tradepost count) is high enough to mitigate Zebra hostility on its own. Only once the Zebras are no longer hostile would the other policy options become viable for optimizing trades with other civilisations.
