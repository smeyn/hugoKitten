[Cultural Exchange]( {{< relref "Policy/Cultural_Exchange.md" >}}) is a mid-game **Foreign policy** that provides a permanent **+5% boost to your culture income**. It represents the strategic choice to send your poets and actors to foreign lands to increase your civilisation's cultural throughput.

### **Requirements and Costs**
To enact this policy, you must meet the following criteria:
*   **Cost:** 4,000 Culture.
*   **Science Prerequisite:** You must have researched [Astronomy]( {{< relref "techs/Astronomy.md" >}}).
*   **Policy Prerequisite:** You must have already enacted the [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "Policy/Diplomacy.md" >}}) policy.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Choosing Cultural Exchange permanently **locks out the Knowledge Sharing policy** for the remainder of your current run.

### **Strategic Comparison**
In *Kittens Game*, players must choose between boosting culture or science via this policy pair:

| Policy | Primary Bonus | Strategic Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Cultural Exchange]( {{< relref "Policy/Cultural_Exchange.md" >}}) | **+5% Culture income** | Preferred because **culture is often a bottleneck** in the mid-game. |
| [Knowledge Sharing]( {{< relref "Policy/Knowledge_Sharing.md" >}}) | **+5% Science income** | Generally skipped because **science is considered "easy"** to generate through other buildings. |

### **Why Choose Cultural Exchange?**
Most experienced players follow the **Diplomacy $\to$ Cultural Exchange** path rather than the Isolationism path. This is because culture is a "slow" resource compared to science, making any percentage boost highly valuable for:
*   **Scaling Manuscripts:** Mid-game technological progress is often gated by the volume of manuscripts you can craft, which require significant amounts of culture.
*   **Policy Branching:** This policy is the logical conclusion of the Diplomacy branch, which focuses on building better relationships with other races to lower trade costs.
*   **Late-Game Efficiency:** In very long runs, such as the **40k Endless Run**, maintaining a steady stream of culture is vital for religious and industrial growth.
