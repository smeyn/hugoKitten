[Transkittenism]( {{< relref "Policy/Transkittenism.md" >}}) is an endgame **Government policy** that allows your civilisation to merge with Artificial Intelligence, effectively neutralising the threat of a machine uprising while significantly boosting your technological infrastructure.

It is generally considered the "best" choice among its tier for long-term runs, especially those focused on space storage and AI-driven production.

### **Costs and Prerequisites**
*   **Culture Cost:** 1,500,000.
*   **Discovery Prerequisite:** You must have successfully completed at least one **trade with the Leviathans**.
*   **Availability:** It is mutually exclusive with the [Necrocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Necrocracy.md" >}}) and [Radical Xenophobia]( {{< relref "Policy/Radical_Xenophobia.md" >}}) policies. Once one is chosen, the others are locked for the remainder of the run.
*   **Critical Restriction:** You **cannot purchase** Transkittenism if the AI Apocalypse has already begun.

### **Core Effects**
The primary benefit of Transkittenism is the total **prevention of the AI Apocalypse**, but it provides several specific mechanical buffs:
*   **Gigaflop Doubling:** AI Cores produce twice as many gigaflops.
*   **Apocalypse Immunity:** The "AI level" no longer carries a downside, and the apocalypse will not occur regardless of your hashrate or gigaflop accumulation.
*   **Workshop Buffs:** The [Machine Learning]( {{< relref "upgrade/Machine_Learning.md" >}}) workshop upgrade becomes stronger.
*   **Storage Synergy:** [AI Bases]( {{< relref "upgrade/AI_Bases.md" >}}) are strengthened. Specifically, each AI Core will boost Moon Base storage by **11%** (up from the base 10%).

### **Strategic Comparison**
When choosing your final government path, Transkittenism competes with two other philosophies:

| Policy | Primary Focus | Best For... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Transkittenism]( {{< relref "Policy/Transkittenism.md" >}}) | AI and Space Storage | **Long runs** requiring massive unobtainium/resource caps. |
| [Necrocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Necrocracy.md" >}}) | Global Production | Runs with high **Black Liquid Sorrow (BLS)** levels. |
| [Radical Xenophobia]( {{< relref "Policy/Radical_Xenophobia.md" >}}) | Pacts and Mausoleums | Increasing the efficacy of [Mausoleums]( {{< relref "transcendence/Mausoleum.md" >}}) and gaining free Pacts. |

### **The "Meta" Verdict**
While some strategy guides describe the extra gigaflops as "pretty meh," the policy is highly valued in the **deep endgame** because it allows you to build as many AI Cores as you wish without risk. This is essential for scaling **Moon Base storage**, which is a key component in reaching the 8.14 billion unobtainium cap required for the 100-Chronosphere "Positive Reset" loop.

Are you currently reaching a point where your AI Cores are threatening to start an apocalypse, or are you just looking for that extra 1% storage boost for your Moon Bases?
