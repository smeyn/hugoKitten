[Autocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Autocracy.md" >}}) is a policy available in the **Government** category within the *Kittens Game* policy system. It is a Tier 2 Government policy, following the choice of either [Liberty]( {{< relref "Policy/Liberty.md" >}}) or [Tradition]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}).

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Autocracy policy:

### Overview and Cost

*   **Cost:** Autocracy costs **1500 Culture**.
*   **Prerequisites:** Requires researching [Writing]( {{< relref "techs/Writing.md" >}}) and having previously chosen either [Liberty]( {{< relref "Policy/Liberty.md" >}}) or [Tradition]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}).
*   **Locks:** Choosing Autocracy locks out both the [Monarchy]( {{< relref "Policy/Monarchy.md" >}}) and [Republic]( {{< relref "Policy/Republic.md" >}}) Policy/.
*   **Description:** It is considered the "Best for societies with highly promoted kittens".

### Effects of Autocracy

The Autocracy policy provides two distinct benefits focused on leveraging a highly promoted leader and conversion production:

1.  **Leader Production Bonus:** The leader's production bonus is **multiplied by 2** (x2).
2.  **Conversion Production Bonus:** The leader increases conversion production based on the number of uncapped housing buildings. This bonus amounts to **0.4% per leader rank per uncapped population building** applied to all conversion production during the [Cath]( {{< relref "planet/Cath.md" >}}) cycle.

**Conversion production** specifically includes resources produced by **Smelters, Calciners, and Accelerators**.

**Uncapped population buildings** refers to housing structures (Huts, Log Houses, Mansions) for which you have sufficient storage capacity to build more, but have chosen not to.

### Strategic Context and Policy Path

Autocracy is part of a crucial path that dictates subsequent Government policy options:

*   **Policy Path:** Autocracy allows access to [Socialism]( {{< relref "Policy/Socialism.md" >}}) (which currently has no effect) and subsequently [Communism]( {{< relref "Policy/Communism.md" >}}) or [Fascism]( {{< relref "Policy/Fascism.md" >}}). This progression requires building a [Factory]( {{< relref "buildings/Factory.md" >}}).
*   **Endgame Strategy (Iron Will):** For self-imposed restriction runs, such as the Iron Will 40K run, one suggested policy path is **Tradition $\to$ Autocracy $\to$ Communism**. This specific path is chosen because [Communism]( {{< relref "Policy/Communism.md" >}}) provides better Time Crystal results.
*   **General Assessment:** While the doubling of the leader's effect is considered *amazing* for [Monarchy]( {{< relref "Policy/Monarchy.md" >}}) (which follows Tradition) due to multiplying the leader's trait bonus, Autocracy's base doubling of the leader's *production bonus* and its conversion production boost are generally considered minor when compared to Monarchy's flexibility and scaling potential through traits. Autocracy and Republic grant "tiny bonuses that are dwarfed by pretty much everything else".

If you were seeking maximum immediate leverage from your leader, Monarchy is generally recommended. However, Autocracy offers a specific advantage for players focused on highly promoted kittens and boosting resource conversion structures like Smelters, Calciners, and Accelerators, particularly during the Cath cycle.
