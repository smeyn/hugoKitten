[Open Woodlands]( {{< relref "Policy/Open_Woodlands.md" >}}) is a mid-to-late game **Environment policy** that boosts raw resource output at the cost of increased pollution. It is part of the [Environmentalism]( {{< relref "Policy/Environmentalism.md" >}}) branch of the policy tree and becomes available once you have established a stable cultural and scientific foundation.

### **Core Mechanics**
*   **Cost:** 10,000 Culture.
*   **Primary Effect:** Provides a **+12.5% boost** to both **Wood and Mineral** production.
*   **Drawback:** Increases **Pollution by +5%**.
*   **Prerequisites:** You must have researched the [Ecology]( {{< relref "techs/Ecology.md" >}}) technology and previously enacted the [Environmentalism]( {{< relref "Policy/Environmentalism.md" >}}) policy.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Choosing Open Woodlands permanently locks out the [Conservation]( {{< relref "Policy/Conservation.md" >}}) policy for the remainder of the run.

### **Strategic Comparison**
In most playthroughs, [Open Woodlands]( {{< relref "Policy/Open_Woodlands.md" >}}) is considered the superior choice compared to its alternative, [Conservation]( {{< relref "Policy/Conservation.md" >}}). 

*   **Production vs. Morale:** While Conservation provides a small happiness boost and reduces pollution, the production bonuses from Open Woodlands are generally viewed as more impactful for scaling a growing village.
*   **Resource Scaling:** The 12.5% boost to wood and minerals provides essential throughput for mid-game building projects, making it a "must-have" for players focused on rapid economic expansion.

### **Iron Will Specifics**
For players engaged in an **Iron Will** run (playing without kittens), Open Woodlands provides specialized utility:
*   **Catnip Refinement:** Grants a **4.16% bonus** to catnip-to-wood refinement.
*   **Meteor Rewards:** Provides a **4.16% bonus** to minerals gathered from meteor events.

### **Environmental Impact**
Like many industrial-leaning policies, the +5% pollution penalty can eventually lead to reduced catnip production and lower kitten happiness if not managed. However, by the time you can afford the 10,000 culture cost, your infrastructure is typically robust enough to absorb this penalty in exchange for higher material yields.
