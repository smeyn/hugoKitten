**Full Industrialisation** is an advanced environment policy that boosts the effectiveness of your factories' crafting bonuses. It represents the choice to prioritise industrial throughput over environmental preservation.

### **Core Stats and Requirements**
*   **Cost:** 10,000 Culture.
*   **Prerequisites:** You must have researched the **Industrialisation** technology and already enacted either the [Strip Mining]( {{< relref "Policy/Strip_Mining.md" >}}) or [Clear Cutting]( {{< relref "Policy/Clear_Cutting.md" >}}) policy.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Enacting this policy permanently locks out the [Sustainability]( {{< relref "Policy/Sustainability.md" >}}) policy for the current run.

### **Primary Effects**
The policy focuses on squeezing more production out of your industrial infrastructure at a cost to the climate:
*   **Enhanced Factories:** Increases the power of your factories by **5%**. This means a factory providing a base 5% crafting bonus will instead provide **5.25%**, or a factory boosted by Logistics to 6% will provide **6.3%**.
*   **Pollution Penalty:** Increases your global pollution levels by **+5%**. High pollution can eventually lead to reduced catnip production, lower happiness, and slower kitten arrival speeds.

### **Strategic Advice**
*   **Run Timing:** Most experienced players recommend choosing [Sustainability]( {{< relref "Policy/Sustainability.md" >}}) on your first run to avoid happiness penalties. From your second run onwards, when you are building a larger number of factories, Full Industrialisation becomes the "obvious pick" for its crafting benefits.
*   **Resource Staging:** It is best to wait until you have at least 2,000 Science to spare and a solid cultural foundation before pushing for this policy.
*   **Industrial Synergy:** This policy is a key component for scaling your industry into the late game, as it stacks with other factory upgrades like [Factory Logistics]( {{< relref "upgrade/Factory_Logistics.md" >}}) (+20% crafting) and [Factory Processing]( {{< relref "upgrade/Factory_Processing.md" >}}).

### **Endgame Utility: The Space Loop**
In the late game, Full Industrialisation becomes critical for space expansion. Once you research [Space Manufacturing]( {{< relref "upgrade/Space_Manufacturing.md" >}}), your factories begin to provide a bonus to space structures like [Space Elevators]( {{< relref "space/space_elevator.md" >}}) and [Orbital Arrays]( {{< relref "space/orbital_array.md" >}}). 

Because Full Industrialisation increases the base power of these factories, it directly accelerates your **unobtainium production** in space. This makes it a foundational policy for players aiming to build a self-sustaining **positive chrono-reset engine** using Chronospheres.
