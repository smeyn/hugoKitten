In **Kittens Game**, [Shark Relations]( {{< relref "Policy/shark_relations.md" >}}) refers to the trade mechanics and specialized policies associated with the Sharks, a neutral trade race discovered in the early-to-mid game. They are primarily used to acquire **Catnip** and cultural resources like [Parchment]( {{< relref "craft/Parchment.md" >}}) and [Manuscripts]( {{< relref "resource/manuscript.md" >}}) in exchange for **Iron**.

### **Trade Mechanics**
Sharks are discovered around **Year 20** (or **Year 1** if you have the [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "Policy/Diplomacy.md" >}}) metaphysics upgrade). Their attitude is **Neutral**, meaning they provide no baseline bonus or penalty to trade.

*   **Primary Trade:** You give **100 Iron**; they give **Catnip**.
*   **Secondary Gains:** Successful trades have a chance to yield [Parchment]( {{< relref "craft/Parchment.md" >}}) (25%), [Manuscripts]( {{< relref "resource/manuscript.md" >}}) (15%), and [Compendiums]( {{< relref "resource/Compendium.md" >}}) (10%).
*   **Seasonal Bonus:** They are most effective in **Winter**, providing a **+45% bonus** to catnip rewards.
*   **Iron Will Strategy:** In a "Black Sky" challenge, Sharks trade iron for [Science]( {{< relref "resource/science.md" >}}) instead of catnip.

### **Shark Relations Policies**
Once you reach **Shark Embassy Level 20** and possess the [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "Policy/Diplomacy.md" >}}) metaphysics upgrade, you can enact one of three **mutually exclusive** policies. Choosing one locks out the other two for that run.

| Policy | Effect | Best Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scribes** | +25% Parchment chance, +15% Manuscript chance; **+50% Iron cost** per trade. | Accelerating science when you have a massive surplus of Iron. |
| **Merchants** | +3% Trade Ratio (scales up to +30% based on total trades completed). | Long-term scaling of all trade rewards. |
| **Botanists** | -75% Bio Lab energy, +1% Brewery catpower bonus, +25% Wood crafting bonus. | Managing energy deficits or boosting late-game wood production. |

### **Strategic Synergies**
The Sharks are a core component of the **"Winter Trade Loop,"** which players use to bypass resource bottlenecks.

1.  **The Loop:** In **Winter**, trade Iron to the Sharks for massive amounts of **Catnip**. Refine that catnip into **Wood**, then trade the wood to the [Griffins]( {{< relref "trade/Griffins.md" >}}) for **Iron**.
2.  **Culture Grind:** In challenges like **Pacifism**, where hunting for furs (to make parchment) is disabled, Sharks are the primary source of early cultural resources. Investing in **Shark Embassies** speeds up manuscript gains significantly.
3.  **Pollution Mitigation:** While not a direct trade benefit, the **Lizard Relations: Ecologists** policy reduces pollution, which helps preserve the high catnip production levels that the Sharks can supplement.

### **Hostility and Standing**
While the Sharks are neutral, other races like the [Griffins]( {{< relref "trade/Griffins.md" >}}) and [Zebras]( {{< relref "trade/zebras.md" >}}) are hostile. Using [Tradeposts]( {{< relref "buildings/Tradepost.md" >}}) and the [Caravanserai]( {{< relref "upgrade/Caravanserai.md" >}}) upgrade improves your standing with all races, but the Sharks' neutral starting point makes them a reliable trade partner even before these upgrades are maxed out.

Are you currently using the Sharks to push through a cultural resource bottleneck, or are you looking to optimize your energy consumption with the Botanists policy?
