[City On A Hill]( {{< relref "Policy/City_On_A_Hill.md" >}}) is a mid-game **Foreign policy** in *Kittens Game* that provides a small **+5% increase to your maximum culture cap**. It represents an isolationist approach where your village seeks to be a "shining example" to the rest of the world.

### **Strategic Utility**
While a larger culture cap can be helpful for researching advanced technologies like [Theology]( {{< relref "science/Theology.md" >}}), this policy is generally considered a suboptimal choice for several reasons:

*   **Weak Bonus:** Compared to other global multipliers, a 5% increase to the culture cap is relatively minor and often described as "kinda sucking" in strategic guides.
*   **The Big Stick Alternative:** By choosing City On A Hill, you permanently lock yourself out of the [Big Stick Policy]( {{< relref "Policy/Big_Stick_Policy.md" >}}) for the remainder of the run. Big Stick Policy provides a **15% discount on Embassies**, which is widely viewed as more practically useful for progressing trade relations with other civilisations.
*   **Isolationist Drawbacks:** Because this policy requires the [Isolationism]( {{< relref "Policy/Isolationism.md" >}}) prerequisite, you are already trading away the benefits of the [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "Policy/Diplomacy.md" >}}) policy branch, which offers better trade efficiency and faster discovery of other races.

### **Strategic Recommendation**
Most experienced players advise **skipping City On A Hill** in favour of the [Big Stick Policy]( {{< relref "Policy/Big_Stick_Policy.md" >}}) if you have committed to the Isolationism branch. If your goal is to increase culture throughput or cap, investment in [Amphitheatres]( {{< relref "buildings/Amphitheatre.md" >}}), [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}), and **Academies** typically provides more substantial results without the opportunity cost of a policy slot.

Are you currently hitting your culture cap too quickly, or are you looking for this policy specifically to reach the requirements for a high-tier science like [Theology]( {{< relref "science/Theology.md" >}}) or [Acoustics]( {{< relref "techs/Acoustics.md" >}})?
