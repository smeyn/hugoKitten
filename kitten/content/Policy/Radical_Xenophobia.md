[Radical Xenophobia]( {{< relref "Policy/Radical_Xenophobia.md" >}}) is an endgame government policy in *Kittens Game* that prioritises the rejection of "evil aliens and evil robots" in favour of self-reliance. It costs **1,500,000 Culture** to enact and is primarily focused on enhancing [Mausoleums]( {{< relref "transcendence/Mausoleum.md" >}}) and the **Pact** system.

### **Key Statistics and Requirements**

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | 1,500,000 Culture |
| **Prerequisite** | At least one successful trade with the [Leviathans]( {{< relref "trade/Leviathans.md" >}}) |
| **Mutual Exclusivity** | Selecting this locks out [Transkittenism]( {{< relref "Policy/Transkittenism.md" >}}) and [Necrocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Necrocracy.md" >}}) for the current run |

### **Core Effects and Benefits**
The policy provides specific bonuses to cryptotheology and resource management:
*   **Mausoleum Buff:** It increases the **efficacy of all Mausoleums**, effectively doubling their impact. 
*   **Free Pacts:** It immediately grants **5 free Pacts**. 
*   **Pact Unlocking:** Along with the Mausoleum upgrade, this policy is one of two ways to make **Pacts** available for purchase in the religion tab.

### **Strategic Analysis**
While Radical Xenophobia offers unique bonuses, it is often viewed as a niche choice compared to its counterparts:
*   **Strategic Delay:** Experienced players generally recommend holding off on this tier of policy as long as possible, as the initial benefits of Pacts are considered minimal and the "necrocorn debt" required to maintain them can be steep.
*   **Holy Genocide Synergy:** Some strategic advice suggests that Radical Xenophobia remains "worthless" until [Holy Genocide]( {{< relref "transcendence/Holy_Genocide.md" >}}) (a high-tier cryptotheology building) becomes available, which unlocks the **Post Apocalypse** challenge. 
*   **Comparison:** Most players opt for [Transkittenism]( {{< relref "Policy/Transkittenism.md" >}}) to prevent AI uprisings and boost space storage, or [Necrocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Necrocracy.md" >}}) for global production bonuses tied to Black Liquid Sorrow (BLS).

### **Understanding Pacts**
If you choose this policy, you gain access to different types of Pacts (such as the **Pact of Cleansing** or **Pact of Destruction**) which provide global resource limits or production bonuses based on your number of [Black Pyramids]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Black_Pyramid.md" >}}). However, failure to pay the required necrocorn upkeep can lead to a **Broken Pact**, which imposes a severe **50% penalty** to global storage and production.
