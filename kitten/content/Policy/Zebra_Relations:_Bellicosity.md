title = "Zebra Relations: Bellicosity"

+++
**Zebra Relations: Bellicosity** is a mid-game **Foreign policy** that prioritises relations with other civilisations by taking a harder stance against the Zebras. While it improves your standing with most trade partners, it significantly hinders your ability to acquire [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}).

### **Core Effects and Costs**
*   **Cost:** 5,000 Culture.
*   **Prerequisite:** You must have met the Zebras (discovered after building your first Trade Ship).
*   **Zebra Penalty:** Your relations with the Zebras worsen, equivalent to losing **10 Tradeposts**.
*   **Global Standing Bonus:** Your relations with all other races improve, equivalent to adding **5 Tradeposts**.
*   **Titanium Reduction:** It applies a multiplicative penalty to the amount of titanium Zebras sell, equivalent to **-10 Tradeposts** worth of trade ratio.

### **Comparison: Bellicosity vs. Appeasement**
Choosing Bellicosity permanently locks you out of the **Zebra Relations: Appeasement** policy for that run.

| Feature | Bellicosity | Appeasement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zebra Standing** | **-10 Tradeposts** (Worse) | **+15 Tradeposts** (Better) |
| **Other Races** | **+5 Tradeposts** (Better) | No change |
| **Titanium Yield** | Multiplicative **Penalty** | Multiplicative **Bonus** |
| **Economic Cost** | None | **-5% Gold Income** |

### **Strategic Advice**
In most standard runs, Bellicosity is considered a **suboptimal choice** because Titanium is one of the most critical mid-game bottlenecks. 

*   **The Titanium Bottleneck:** Since Zebras are the primary source of Titanium, making them more hostile and reducing their trade yield is generally counter-productive.
*   **Hostility Mitigation:** Expert advice suggests that **Appeasement** is the only real option until you have enough [Tradeposts]( {{< relref "buildings/Tradepost.md" >}}) (typically 85, or 58 with Diplomacy) to negate Zebra hostility naturally. 
*   **Late Game Viability:** Bellicosity only becomes viable once Zebra hostility has been completely negated through infrastructure, and you wish to marginally boost trades with friendly races like the Lizards or Sharks.
