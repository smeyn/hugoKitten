In **Kittens Game**, [Sustainability]( {{< relref "Policy/Sustainability.md" >}}) is an environmental policy that focuses on mitigating the negative effects of industrialisation by removing happiness penalties and slightly reducing pollution. 

### **Core Mechanics**
*   **Cost:** 10,000 Culture.
*   **Primary Effect:** It removes the **-2% happiness penalty** associated with the [Strip Mining]( {{< relref "Policy/Strip_Mining.md" >}}) or [Clear Cutting]( {{< relref "Policy/Clear_Cutting.md" >}}) policies.
*   **Secondary Effect:** It provides a **-5% reduction** to overall pollution levels.
*   **Prerequisites:** You must have researched [Industrialization]( {{< relref "techs/Industrialization.md" >}}) and enacted either the [Strip Mining]( {{< relref "Policy/Strip_Mining.md" >}}) or [Clear Cutting]( {{< relref "Policy/Clear_Cutting.md" >}}) policy.

### **Sustainability vs. Full Industrialization**
Sustainability is part of a mutually exclusive pair; once you choose it, you are locked out of [Full Industrialization]( {{< relref "Policy/Full_Industrialization.md" >}}) for the remainder of that run.

| Feature | Sustainability | Full Industrialization |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Main Benefit** | Removes happiness penalties from mining/logging. | Improves **Factory crafting bonus** by 5%. |
| **Pollution** | Reduces pollution by 5%. | **Increases** pollution by 5%. |
| **Kitten Morale** | Better for keeping kittens happy. | Focuses on raw industrial output. |

### **Strategic Utility**
*   **Early Game (First Run):** Sustainability is often recommended for your **first run**. At this stage, you typically only have a single factory to unlock the policy, so the crafting bonus from Full Industrialization is negligible compared to the benefit of maintaining kitten happiness.
*   **Mid-to-Late Game:** From your **second run onwards**, most players switch to [Full Industrialization]( {{< relref "Policy/Full_Industrialization.md" >}}). Once you begin building a large number of factories, the multiplicative crafting bonus becomes far more valuable than the small happiness and pollution benefits offered by Sustainability.
*   **Pollution Management:** While Sustainability helps reduce pollution, it is noted that some pollution is inevitable as your civilisation grows. High pollution can harm catnip production, happiness, and kitten arrival speed. Sustainability is one of the few ways to actively mitigate these atmospheric effects.
