Policy: Carnivale
Distinct from the Metaphysics upgrade, the Carnivale policy is an environmental and philosophical choice found in the Science tab.
• Cost: 3500 Culture.
• Prerequisites: You must have the Epicureanism policy active. Enacting Carnivale will permanently lock you out of the Extravagance policy for that run.
• Effects:
    ◦ +30% Festival Growth Rate: Kittens arrive significantly faster while a festival is active.
    ◦ +30% Luxury Consumption: Rare resources (furs, ivory, spice) are consumed 30% faster during festivals.
Strategic Utility and Synergies
• Early Game: Both the upgrade and the policy are generally considered unnecessary for your first few runs. At this stage, the resource cost for festivals is often too high to justify the bonuses.
• Mid-to-Late Game: Once your economy can support constant festivals, the [Carnivals]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Carnivals.md" >}}) Metaphysics upgrade becomes very high-value for idling, as you can queue up many years of festivals at once.
• Brewery Synergy: The effectiveness of festivals (and thus the value of Carnivals/Carnivale) is increased by building Breweries. These buildings provide bonuses to festival happiness (+1%), cycle bonuses (+1%), and kitten arrival speed (+0.1%).
• Kitten Grinding: If your current goal is Paragon farming, the combination of the Carnivale policy and several Breweries can significantly decrease the time it takes to reach your population cap.
Are you currently aiming to speed up your kitten arrival rate for a reset, or are you looking to unlock the deeper Metaphysics tree for religious bonuses?
