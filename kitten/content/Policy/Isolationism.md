In **Kittens Game**, [Isolationism]( {{< relref "Policy/Isolationism.md" >}}) is a Foreign policy that focuses on economic protectionism by reducing the amount of gold required for each trade mission.

### **Core Mechanics**
*   **Cost:** 1,600 Culture.
*   **Prerequisite:** You must have researched the [Currency]( {{< relref "techs/Currency.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Primary Effect:** Each trade mission costs **1 less gold**.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Enacting Isolationism permanently locks you out of the [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "Policy/Diplomacy.md" >}}) policy for the remainder of that run.

### **The Isolationism Policy Branch**
Choosing Isolationism unlocks a specific path of follow-up policies available after you research [Astronomy]( {{< relref "techs/Astronomy.md" >}}):

| Policy | Cost | Effect | Mutual Exclusivity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Big Stick Policy]( {{< relref "Policy/Big_Stick_Policy.md" >}}) | 4,000 Culture | **Embassies** are 15% cheaper to build. | Locks [City On A Hill]( {{< relref "Policy/City_On_A_Hill.md" >}}). |
| [City On A Hill]( {{< relref "Policy/City_On_A_Hill.md" >}}) | 4,000 Culture | Increases the **Culture cap** by 5%. | Locks [Big Stick Policy]( {{< relref "Policy/Big_Stick_Policy.md" >}}). |

### **Strategic Utility**
The choice between Isolationism and Diplomacy is often a significant decision for early-to-mid-game trade management.

*   **Gold Management:** Isolationism is primarily useful if [gold]( {{< relref "resource/Gold.md" >}}) is your main bottleneck for trading. Some players find it preferable for facilitating high-volume exchanges with the [Nagas]( {{< relref "trade/Nagas.md" >}}), which are critical for mineral supplies.
*   **Comparison to Diplomacy:** While the gold discount "might feel good," many experienced players consider the Isolationism branch to be weaker than the Diplomacy branch. Diplomacy reduces the **catpower** cost of trades (by 5) and leads to [Cultural Exchange]( {{< relref "Policy/Cultural_Exchange.md" >}}) (+5% culture income), which addresses a much more persistent bottleneck in the mid-game.
*   **Policy Efficiency:** The follow-up policies in this branch are often described as suboptimal. [Big Stick Policy]( {{< relref "Policy/Big_Stick_Policy.md" >}}) and [City On A Hill]( {{< relref "Policy/City_On_A_Hill.md" >}}) are noted for being relatively "weak" compared to the bonuses offered by the Diplomacy-based alternatives.

### **Advanced Synergies**
In an **Iron Will** run (playing without kittens), Isolationism can be part of a strategy to reach the space era by prioritising cheaper embassies and specific trade loops to overcome the lack of a workforce.

Are you currently finding it difficult to maintain enough [gold]( {{< relref "resource/Gold.md" >}}) for your trade routes, or are you looking to lower the **catpower** costs of your hunters and explorers instead?
