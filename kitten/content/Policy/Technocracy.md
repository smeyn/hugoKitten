[Technocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Technocracy.md" >}}) is a high-tier Government policy that provides a **20% increase to your maximum science storage capacity**. While this sounds substantial, it is generally considered the least effective option in its tier because there are many other ways to expand science storage that do not require sacrificing a policy slot.

### **Key Statistics**
*   **Cost:** 150,000 Culture.
*   **Requirement:** You must have **reached Dune** to unlock it.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Enacting Technocracy permanently locks you out of [Cosmological Libertarianism]( {{< relref "Policy/Cosmological_Libertarianism.md" >}}) and [Order of the Stars]( {{< relref "Policy/Order_of_the_Stars.md" >}}) for the remainder of the run.

### **Strategic Analysis: Why it is often Skipped**
In the late game, science storage is rarely the primary bottleneck. Players have access to numerous structures and items that expand this cap, making the 20% boost from Technocracy redundant:
*   **Science Buildings:** Libraries (and their upgrade, Data Centers), Academies, Observatories, and Bio Labs all provide flat and percentage-based science cap increases.
*   [Compendiums:]( {{< relref "resource/Compendium.md" >}}) Every Compendium you craft increases your science storage by 10 units.
*   **Late-Game Structures:** Research Vessels and Space Beacons provide massive science cap boosts (+10k and +25k respectively).

### **Superior Alternatives**
Because you can only choose one policy at this tier, the community generally recommends the other two options depending on your current goals:
*   [Cosmological Libertarianism:]( {{< relref "Policy/Cosmological_Libertarianism.md" >}}) Provides **+15% Unobtainium production**. Unobtainium is a much harder bottleneck to clear than science storage, making this the "meta" choice for most players.
*   [Order of the Stars:]( {{< relref "Policy/Order_of_the_Stars.md" >}}) Provides **+20% Faith production**. This is ideal for long runs focused on grinding Transcendence tiers and religious bonuses.

### **When to Consider Technocracy**
Technocracy is only truly useful if you are attempting to reach a specific, massive science threshold for an endgame technology (like [Blackchain]( {{< relref "techs/Blackchain.md" >}}) or [Exophysics]( {{< relref "techs/Exophysics.md" >}})) and have already maxed out all other science storage options without reaching the required amount.
