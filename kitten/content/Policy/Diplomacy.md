In *Kittens Game*, [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "Policy/Diplomacy.md" >}}) refers to both a foundational **Metaphysics upgrade** and a mid-game **Foreign policy**. Both systems focus on improving your relations with other civilisations to make trading more efficient and accessible.

### **1. Diplomacy (Foreign Policy)**
This policy is one of the first major choices you make regarding your international relations.
*   **Cost:** 1,600 Culture.
*   **Prerequisites:** Researching [Currency]( {{< relref "techs/Currency.md" >}}).
*   **Primary Effect:** Reduces the cost of every trade by **5 catpower**.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Selecting Diplomacy permanently locks you out of the [Isolationism]( {{< relref "Policy/Isolationism.md" >}}) policy for the current run.

**Strategic Advice:** 
Experienced players generally recommend **Diplomacy over Isolationism**. While Isolationism offers a gold discount, Diplomacy is considered superior because it leads to the [Cultural Exchange]( {{< relref "Policy/Cultural_Exchange.md" >}}) policy, which provides a **+5% boost to culture income**—addressing one of the game's most persistent mid-game bottlenecks.

### **2. Diplomacy (Metaphysics Upgrade)**
This is a permanent upgrade purchased with [Paragon]( {{< relref "resource/paragon.md" >}}) that persists across game resets.
*   **Cost:** 5 Paragon.
*   **Core Effects:** 
    *   **Earlier Discovery:** Races can be discovered as early as **Year 1** (instead of Year 5).
    *   **Better Standing:** Increases your standing ratio with other races by 10, making them more likely to be friendly.
*   **The Diplomacy Tree:** Purchasing this unlocks several follow-up upgrades, including:
    *   **Zebra Diplomacy (35 Paragon):** Allows a percentage of your Zebras to stay when ending an Iron Will run.
    *   **Navigation Diplomacy (300 Paragon):** Allows races to be discovered as soon as you have **Ships**.

### **3. Advanced Race Relations**
Once you have the **Diplomacy metaphysics upgrade** and reach an **Embassy level of 20** with specific races, you unlock specialized diplomatic policies:

| Policy Name | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lizard Relations: Diplomats** | Increases standing ratio by 0.1% per Embassy with neutral races. |
| **Shark Relations: Merchants** | Increases trade ratio by 3%, scaling up to 30% based on total trades completed. |
| **Griffin Relations: Scouts** | Increases **hunting effectiveness by 50%**. |
| **Naga Relations: Architects** | Increases blueprint trade chance by 0.25% per embassy (up to 10%). |

### **Clarifying Question**
Are you trying to decide between the [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "Policy/Diplomacy.md" >}}) and [Isolationism]( {{< relref "Policy/Isolationism.md" >}}) policies for your current run, or are you looking for the best way to resolve **Zebra hostility** to get more Titanium?
