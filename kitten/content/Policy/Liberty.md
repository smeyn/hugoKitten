+++
[Liberty]( {{< relref "Policy/Liberty.md" >}}) is an early-game **Government policy** designed for societies that prioritise kitten morale and population growth. It is one of the first major ideological choices you will make after researching [Writing]( {{< relref "techs/Writing.md" >}}).

### **Costs and Prerequisites**
*   **Culture Cost:** 150.
*   **Science Prerequisite:** You must have researched [Writing]( {{< relref "techs/Writing.md" >}}).
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Enacting Liberty permanently **locks the Tradition policy** for the duration of your current run.

### **Core Effects**
Liberty provides two immediate mechanical benefits to your village:
*   **Happiness Scaling:** It increases the **production bonus derived from happiness by 10%**. This makes every point of happiness more effective at boosting your resource output.
*   **Free Housing:** It grants **one free housing slot**, allowing you to host an additional kitten without building further Huts or Log Houses.

### **Strategic Utility: Liberty vs. Tradition**
The choice between Liberty and Tradition is a common point of debate among players, as they cater to different stages of game progression:

| Feature | Liberty | Tradition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | **Happiness & Production**. | **Culture & Science**. |
| **Main Benefit** | +10% happiness production effect. | Reduced Manuscript costs. |
| **Secondary Benefit** | +1 free housing slot. | Doubled Manuscript max culture effect. |
| **Best For...** | **Early runs** with low Karma where happiness is a struggle. | **Mid-to-late runs** where culture is the primary bottleneck. |

### **The "Noob Trap" Debate**
While Liberty is often recommended for **first-time players** to offset the production penalties caused by unhappy kittens, some veteran guides label it a **"noob trap"**. This is because culture and manuscripts become massive bottlenecks very quickly; [Tradition]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}) helps bypass these hurdles more effectively than the small happiness boost from Liberty.

### **Progression Path**
Choosing Liberty sets you on a specific "Liberal" branch of government policies:
1.  **Republic (1,500 Culture):** Follows Liberty and provides a global job bonus to all kittens based on your leader's rank.
2.  **Socialism (7,500 Culture):** A follow-up to Republic that is noted in the records as having **no actual effect** on gameplay.
3.  **Liberalism (15,000 Culture):** A powerful late-game choice that improves trade relations and **reduces all gold costs by 20%**.

Are you currently finding it difficult to keep your kittens happy as your population grows, or are you preparing to grind for the [Theology]( {{< relref "science/Theology.md" >}}) science which requires a high volume of manuscripts?
