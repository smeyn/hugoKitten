[Space expansionism]( {{< relref "Policy/Space_expansionism.md" >}}) in *Kittens Game* refers to the phase where your civilisation leaves its home planet, Cath, to colonise the solar system. This era is officially unlocked by researching the [Rocketry]( {{< relref "techs/Rocketry.md" >}}) technology, which enables the Space tab and allows you to build rockets for interstellar missions.

### **Initial Unlocking and Missions**
To begin your expansion, you must first navigate the "Titanium Era" to secure the necessary materials and storage caps. The first milestone is [Orbital Launch]( {{< relref "space/Orbital_Launch.md" >}}), which requires a significant investment in Starcharts, Catpower, Science, and Oil.

Key initial missions include:
*   [Orbital Launch:]( {{< relref "space/Orbital_Launch.md" >}}) Unlocks the ability to deploy Satellites and build Space Elevators.
*   [Moon Mission:]( {{< relref "space/Moon_Mission.md" >}}) The most critical early goal, as it provides access to [Unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}}) through Lunar Outposts and significantly expanded storage via Moon Bases.
*   [Dune Mission:]( {{< relref "space/Dune_Mission.md" >}}) Provides a source of Uranium (via Planet Crackers) and high-pressure Oil (via Hydraulic Fracturers).
*   [Piscine Mission:]( {{< relref "space/Piscine_Mission.md" >}}) Unlocks Research Vessels, which are essential for generating large quantities of Starcharts in the mid-to-late game.

### **Critical Resources for Space**
Successful space expansion relies on several specific resources that become the primary bottlenecks of the late game:
*   **Starcharts:** Found by observing astronomical events or produced by Satellites and Research Vessels; these are the "currency" of space travel.
*   **Unobtainium (UO):** A rare resource refined from Uranium at Lunar Outposts. It is the gateway to [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}), [Eludium]( {{< relref "resource/eludium.md" >}}), and the endgame storage loops.
*   **Oil and Kerosene:** Oil is used for initial launches, while advanced missions require [Kerosene]( {{< relref "resource/kerosene.md" >}}), a fuel processed from oil.
*   [Antimatter:]( {{< relref "resource/Antimatter.md" >}}) Produced by [Sunlifters]( {{< relref "space/sunlifter.md" >}}) ([Helios]( {{< relref "planet/Helios.md" >}})), it is used for high-tier upgrades and increasing resource caps.

### **Strategic Optimization**
Space expansion is not just about exploring; it is a mechanism for scaling your civilisation’s resource caps geometrically.
*   [Space Manufacturing:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Space_Manufacturing.md" >}}) This is a vital workshop upgrade that allows your **Factories** to improve the production of space buildings. Without this, space structures often provide marginal returns.
*   **Global Multipliers:** Buildings like the [Space Elevator]( {{< relref "space/space_elevator.md" >}}) (reduces oil costs) and [Orbital Array]( {{< relref "space/orbital_array.md" >}}) (provides a 2% bonus to all space structures) are essential for making expansion efficient.
*   **Storage Caps:** Late-game progression is gated by the 8.14 billion Unobtainium storage requirement needed for 100 Chronospheres. This is achieved through massive investment in **Moon Bases**, **Cryostations**, and [AI Bases]( {{< relref "upgrade/AI_Bases.md" >}}).

### **Planetary Destinations and Utilities**
| Destination | Key Structure | Primary Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Redmoon]( {{< relref "planet/Redmoon.md" >}}) | Lunar Outpost | Primary source of [Unobtainium]( {{< relref "resource/unobtainium.md" >}}). |
| [Dune]( {{< relref "planet/Dune.md" >}}) | Planet Cracker | High-volume Uranium production. |
| [Piscine]( {{< relref "planet/Piscine.md" >}}) | Research Vessel | Massive Science and Starchart generation. |
| [Helios]( {{< relref "planet/Helios.md" >}}) | Sunlifter | Primary source of [Antimatter]( {{< relref "resource/Antimatter.md" >}}). |
| **T-Minus** | Cryostation | Massive storage for base metals and Unobtainium. |
| [Kairo]( {{< relref "planet/Kairo.md" >}}) | Space Beacon | Late-game Relic and Science production. |

Are you currently preparing for your first [Moon Mission]( {{< relref "space/Moon_Mission.md" >}}), or are you focusing on building up your **Starchart** production to reach the further rings of the solar system?
