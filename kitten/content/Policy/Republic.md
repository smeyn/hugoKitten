[Republic]( {{< relref "Policy/Republic.md" >}}) is a mid-game Government policy that provides a global production bonus to your entire kitten population based on the **rank of your current leader**. 

### **Core Mechanics**
To enact the Republic policy, your civilisation must meet the following requirements:
*   **Cost:** 1500 Culture.
*   **Prerequisites:** You must have researched [Writing]( {{< relref "techs/Writing.md" >}}) and already enacted the [Liberty]( {{< relref "Policy/Liberty.md" >}}) policy.
*   **Mutual Exclusivity:** Choosing Republic permanently locks you out of [Monarchy]( {{< relref "Policy/Monarchy.md" >}}) and [Autocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Autocracy.md" >}}) for the remainder of the run.

### **The Republic Bonus**
While other government forms focus on the leader's individual traits, Republic allows the leader’s experience to benefit every worker. 
*   **Global Effect:** All non-leader kittens receive a job bonus equal to **1% of the leader's own rank bonus**.
*   **Mathematical Formula:** The specific percentage bonus is calculated as `(leader rank + 1) / 70`.
*   **Multiplicative Scaling:** This bonus stacks multiplicatively with other production modifiers, such as happiness or workshop upgrades.

### **Strategic Comparison**
In the *Kittens Game* community, Republic is often compared to its alternative, [Monarchy]( {{< relref "Policy/Monarchy.md" >}}):

| Feature | Republic | Monarchy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Best For** | **Large societies** (high kitten count). | **Flexible utility** and specific resource grinding. |
| **Primary Effect** | Small production boost to **all kittens**. | **Doubles** the leader's specific trait (e.g., Artisan or Scientist). |
| **Prerequisite** | [Liberty]( {{< relref "Policy/Liberty.md" >}}). | [Tradition]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}). |
| **Community View** | Often considered to provide "tiny bonuses" compared to Monarchy. | Generally preferred because doubling a leader's trait is highly effective. |

### **Progression and Synergy**
Enacting Republic is a key step in the **Liberty branch** of the policy tree. It typically leads toward:
*   [Liberalism:]( {{< relref "Policy/Liberalism.md" >}}) A peaceful society that improves trade relations and reduces gold costs.
*   **Catpower Scaling:** Choosing the Liberty-Republic-Liberalism path is strategically useful for players aiming to maximise **Templar upgrades**, which increase the catpower cap to aid in ivory generation and trading.

**Note:** To make the most of Republic, you must actively **promote your leader** using gold and experience, as the bonus scales directly with their rank.

Are you currently leaning toward a **high-population build** where global bonuses are more effective, or are you looking to optimise a specific task like **crafting**?
