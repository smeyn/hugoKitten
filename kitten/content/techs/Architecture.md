[Architecture]( {{< relref "techs/Architecture.md" >}}) is a key mid-game technology research that advances your infrastructure by unlocking new buildings, particularly high-tier housing and structures crucial for gold management.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Architecture technology:

### 1. Requirements and Cost

*   **Prerequisite:** Architecture is unlocked after researching [Navigation]( {{< relref "techs/Navigation.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:** Researching Architecture requires **42,000 Science** and **10 Compendium**.
*   **Progression:** Architecture is part of the research path following [Astronomy]( {{< relref "techs/Astronomy.md" >}}) and [Navigation]( {{< relref "techs/Navigation.md" >}}).

### 2. Buildings Unlocked

Architecture unlocks two important mid-game structures: the Mansion and the Mint.

| Building | Cost and Purpose | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Mansion]( {{< relref "buildings/Mansion.md" >}}) | High-tier housing. | Costs 185 Slab, 75 Steel, and 25 Titanium. Provides +1 maximum kitten and +50 maximum catpower. |
| [Mint]( {{< relref "buildings/Mint.md" >}}) | Structure for managing gold and generating rare resources. | Costs 5,000 Minerals, 200 Plate, and 500 Gold. Mints increase gold storage capacity and can generate Furs and Ivory in exchange for Catpower and Gold consumption. |

### 3. Strategic Importance

*   **Population Growth:** Mansions provide additional population capacity, helping sustain kitten growth.
*   **Resource Management:** Mints are useful for increasing your **gold storage limit**, which helps unlock useful culture and catpower bonuses available in the Religion tab. Running Mints temporarily when idling is helpful to stockpile furs.
*   **Progression:** Architecture is required to unlock the next technology, [Acoustics]( {{< relref "techs/Acoustics.md" >}}).

In the accelerated progression for short runs, [Architecture]( {{< relref "techs/Architecture.md" >}}) is one of the technologies targeted early on, costing a total of **70 Compendia** (when combined with Acoustics).
