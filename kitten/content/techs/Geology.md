[Geology]( {{< relref "techs/Geology.md" >}}) is a crucial mid-game technology that opens up advanced mineral extraction, job specialization, and boosts industrial resource production, particularly [Coal]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}) and [Gold]( {{< relref "resource/Gold.md" >}}).

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Geology technology:

### Technology Details and Cost

*   **Prerequisite:** Geology is unlocked by researching [Navigation]( {{< relref "techs/Navigation.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:** Researching Geology requires **65,000 Science** and **65 Compendium**.
*   **Unlocks:** Geology unlocks the [Geologist]( {{< relref "job/Geologist.md" >}}) job, the [Quarry]( {{< relref "buildings/Quarry.md" >}}) building, and the [Geodesy]( {{< relref "upgrade/Geodesy.md" >}}) upgrade. It also unlocks the [Biology]( {{< relref "techs/Biology.md" >}}) technology.

### Key Unlocks and Effects

Geology introduces new ways to gather important base resources, accelerating industrial capacity:

| Unlock | Type | Production/Effect | Details | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Geologist]( {{< relref "job/Geologist.md" >}}) | Job | **Coal per Tick +0.015** | This kitten job is enabled by Geology. | |
| [Quarry]( {{< relref "buildings/Quarry.md" >}}) | Building | **Minerals +35%**, **Coal per Tick +0.015** | This building is unlocked by Geology. | |
| [Geodesy]( {{< relref "upgrade/Geodesy.md" >}}) | Upgrade | Geologists gain **+0.0075 coal/tick** and **+0.0008 gold/tick** | This workshop upgrade makes **Geologists more effective** and allows them to find gold. | |
| [Minerology Department]( {{< relref "zebraUpgrades/Minerology_department.md" >}}) | Upgrade | Not detailed, but listed as a **Zebra Upgrade** associated with Geology | This is an upgrade for the [Academy]( {{< relref "buildings/Academy.md" >}}) building. | |

The Quarry building requires **50 Scaffold**, **125 Steel**, and **1,000 Slab** to construct.

### Strategic Importance

Geology and its associated upgrades are highly valuable for boosting key industrial inputs, especially Gold, which becomes a bottleneck resource during the Titanium era:

*   **Coal and Gold Production:** Strategically, Geology improves both **coal and gold production**.
*   **Gold Generation (Geodesy):** The Geodesy upgrade is considered a major milestone. While the upgrade itself is costly (90,000 Science, 250 Titanium, 500 Starchart), acquiring it **GREATLY increases gold production**. Gold is essential for trading (including the vital trade for Titanium with Zebras) and for funding [Temple]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}) construction.
*   **Resource Bottleneck:** In the Titanium era, once you have enough Observatories to get Starcharts at a healthy rate, players are advised to focus on researching Geology and pushing for [Geodesy]( {{< relref "upgrade/Geodesy.md" >}}).

In essence, researching Geology provides the necessary specialization (Geologists and Quarries) to rapidly scale the production of fundamental inputs (Minerals and Coal) and provides a pathway (Geodesy) to alleviate the mid-game bottleneck associated with [Gold]( {{< relref "resource/Gold.md" >}}), ensuring smoother trade and cultural progression.
