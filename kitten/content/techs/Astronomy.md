[Astronomy]( {{< relref "techs/Astronomy.md" >}}) is a crucial technology in *Kittens Game* that marks the shift into the industrial and space-faring phases, particularly initiating the resource gathering necessary for the **Titanium era**.

### Technical Details and Placement

*   **Prerequisite:** Astronomy is unlocked by researching [Theology]( {{< relref "science/theology.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:** Researching Astronomy requires **28,000 Science** and **65 Manuscripts**.
*   **Placement in Progression:** After overcoming the hurdle of acquiring Theology (which also requires Manuscripts), the next technology, Astronomy, is considered "much easier to acquire," especially if you have a [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}) operational to generate Manuscripts via the Printing Press upgrade.

### Primary Unlocks and Effects

The research of Astronomy unlocks essential buildings and the resources needed for advancement:

1.  **Observatory Building:** Astronomy unlocks the [Observatory]( {{< relref "buildings/Observatory.md" >}}) building.
    *   Observatories boost [Science]( {{< relref "resource/science.md" >}}) production by +25% and increase your **Max Science** by +1000.
    *   They also improve the chance of getting science and starcharts from external events, increasing the **Astronomical Event Chance** by +0.2% and the **Automatic Event Observation Chance** by +1%.
2.  **Starcharts:** Astronomy enables [starcharts]( {{< relref "resource/star_charts.md" >}}) . Starcharts are categorized as an Uncommon Resource, found by observing rare astronomical events.
3.  [Navigation:]( {{< relref "techs/Navigation.md" >}}) Astronomy unlocks the next key technology, [Navigation]( {{< relref "techs/Navigation.md" >}}). Navigation subsequently unlocks other crucial techs like Architecture, Physics, and Geology.
4.  **Policies:** Astronomy, in conjunction with the Diplomacy policy, unlocks foreign policies such as [Knowledge Sharing]( {{< relref "policies/Knowledge_Sharing.md" >}}) and [Cultural Exchange]( {{< relref "policies/Cultural_Exchange.md" >}}).

### Strategic Importance

Astronomy is strategically important because it unlocks the mechanism to acquire **starcharts**, a resource necessary for building [Trade Ships]( {{< relref "craft/Trade_Ship.md" >}}) and ultimately leading to the discovery of the [Zebras]( {{< relref "trade/zebras.md" >}}), who trade essential resources like [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) and **Iron**.

Before researching Astronomy, you may occasionally see a message about "astronomical events" in your log, which allows you to click a button to earn Science. However, once you research Astronomy, observing these events will yield **starcharts**. Because starcharts are a major bottleneck for trade expansion, building many Observatories is prioritized to increase the rate of seeing and automatically clicking on these meteors.

The goal upon reaching this point is to build enough Observatories to get starcharts at a "healthy rate" before focusing heavily on Steel production.
