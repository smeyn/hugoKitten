[Nuclear Fission]( {{< relref "techs/Nuclear_Fission.md" >}}) is a pivotal technology research in the late mid-game, crucial for advancing your industrial infrastructure, especially regarding energy production, titanium refinement, and unlocking access to Uranium trade.

### Unlocking and Cost

*   **Prerequisite:** Nuclear Fission is unlocked after researching [Electronics]( {{< relref "techs/Electronics.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:** Researching Nuclear Fission requires **150,000 Science** and **100 Blueprint**.

### Key Unlocks and Effects

Nuclear Fission provides both industrial capacity and scientific progression:

1.  **Building Unlocked: Reactor**
    *   It unlocks the [Reactor]( {{< relref "buildings/Reactor.md" >}}) mega-structure.
    *   The Reactor costs 3500 Titanium, 5000 Plate, 50 Concrete, and 25 Blueprint.
    *   It provides a substantial **+5% Global Production** bonus.
    *   It generates **+10 Energy** but consumes Uranium at a rate of 0.001 per Tick.
    *   It also increases maximum [Uranium]( {{< relref "resource/uranium.md" >}}) storage by **+250**.

2.  **Workshop Upgrades**
    *   [Nuclear Smelters:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Nuclear_Smelters.md" >}}) This upgrade allows existing [Smelters]( {{< relref "buildings/Smelter.md" >}}) to produce [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) at a rate of **0.0015 per tick**. This provides a domestic source for the critical resource Titanium.
    *   [Reactor Vessel:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Reactor_Vessel.md" >}}) This upgrade improves the ship potential for expanded Harbour capacity, specifically increasing the Harbour capacity limit by 5% per active Reactor past the 225% limit.

3.  **Technology Progression**
    *   Nuclear Fission unlocks two major scientific pathways: [Nanotechnology]( {{< relref "techs/Nanotechnology.md" >}}) and [Particle Physics]( {{< relref "techs/Particle_Physics.md" >}}).

### Strategic Importance

This technology is a mandatory gateway for the Uranium and space exploration phases:

*   **Unlocking Dragons:** Nuclear Fission is the prerequisite for establishing trade relations with the [Dragons]( {{< relref "trade/Dragons.md" >}}). Dragons are essential because they **sell Uranium** in exchange for Titanium (250 units). Uranium is a vital resource for advanced structures and technologies.
*   **Uranium Management:** The Reactor, unlocked here, helps manage the newly introduced [Uranium]( {{< relref "resource/uranium.md" >}}) resource by increasing its storage capacity.
*   **Global Production:** The Reactor's +5% Global Production bonus makes it an attractive investment, helping to boost all resource outputs.

The research path proceeds as part of the broader industrialisation effort: Physics $\to$ Electricity $\to$ Industrialization $\to$ Electronics $\to$ [Nuclear Fission]( {{< relref "techs/Nuclear_Fission.md" >}}).
