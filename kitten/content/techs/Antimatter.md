[Antimatter]( {{< relref "resource/Antimatter.md" >}}) is a high-tier late-game resource in *Kittens Game* that serves as the primary currency for the **Relic Era** and advanced space engineering. It is a non-crafted resource, meaning a portion of it can be preserved across resets if you possess [Chronospheres]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}).

### **Acquisition and Production**
Antimatter is primarily generated through orbital infrastructure in the Helios system:
*   **Unlocking:** It requires the [Superconductors]( {{< relref "techs/Superconductors.md" >}}) technology (225k Science, 175 Blueprints) to access the [Antimatter]( {{< relref "resource/Antimatter.md" >}}) science node, which costs **500k Science and 1 Relic**.
*   [Sunlifters:]( {{< relref "space/sunlifter.md" >}}) These are the primary source of production. Each Sunlifter produces **1 antimatter per year**. 
*   **The Energy Prerequisite:** Antimatter production only occurs if your colony has a **positive energy surplus**. If energy is negative, Sunlifters will not generate antimatter.
*   **Temporal Acceleration:** Because standard production is tied to the game year (which lasts roughly 13 minutes and 20 seconds), players often use the [Chronoforge]( {{< relref "upgrade/Chronoforge.md" >}}) to **combust/shatter Time Crystals**. Each shatter advances the calendar to the next year, triggering an immediate antimatter deposit.

### **Storage and Capacity Milestones**
The default storage capacity for antimatter is **100 units**. Expanding this cap is mandatory for high-level progression:
*   **Containment Chambers:** Constructed in the Kairo system, these provide **+100 max antimatter** each, but consume a heavy 50 Watts of energy.
*   **Heatsinks:** These increase the storage effectiveness of Containment Chambers by **+2%** per building.
*   **The 5,000 Cap Goal:** A major strategic milestone is reaching a **5,000 unit capacity**, which is the cost of a [Relic Station]( {{< relref "upgrade/Relic_Station.md" >}}). To achieve this, a typical configuration requires approximately **34 Heatsinks and 29 Containment Chambers**, supported by significant Paragon levels. If your maximum antimatter is below 5,000, your relic production efficiency is reduced proportionally.

### **Primary Uses**
Antimatter is essential for transitioning into the endgame "Relic Engine" and optimizing space travel:
*   **Relic Era Infrastructure:** It is the core requirement for **Relic Stations (5,000 AM)** and **Space Beacons (50 AM)**, which automate the generation of Relics.
*   **Quantum Computing:** **Entanglement Stations**, which generate hashes for cryptographical attacks on the elders, cost **5,250 AM**.
*   **AI and Automation:** It is required to build **AI Cores (125 AM)** and purchase the [Machine Learning]( {{< relref "upgrade/Machine_Learning.md" >}}) upgrade (125 AM).
*   **Space Upgrades:** Advanced space missions and structures depend on it, including **Terraforming Stations (25 AM)**, **Tectonics (500 AM)**, and **Antimatter Drives (125 AM)**.
*   **Reactor Enhancements:** It is used to upgrade standard infrastructure, such as **Advanced AM Reactors (1,750 AM)** and **Void Reactors (2,500 AM)**.

### **Strategic Considerations**
During the late game, players often engage in a **"Seed Run"**—a very long game session focused specifically on maximizing energy and containment to build a massive antimatter and void stockpile. Once the cap is high enough, you can perform **Positive Resets** with 70+ Chronospheres to exponentially grow your antimatter reserves across subsequent runs. To maximize production during these loops, players often turn off [Thorium Reactors]( {{< relref "upgrade/Thorium_Reactors.md" >}}) except when actively time-skipping to ensure the energy surplus remains positive for antimatter generation.
