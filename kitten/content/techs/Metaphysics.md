[Metaphysics]( {{< relref "techs/Metaphysics.md" >}}) is a core technology research and an associated system of permanent, prestige-based upgrades unlocked in the late mid-game of *Kittens Game*. These upgrades are crucial because, once purchased using [Paragon]( {{< relref "resource/paragon.md" >}}), they carry over across game resets, enabling significantly faster progress in subsequent runs.

### 1. Unlocking and Requirements

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** Metaphysics is unlocked by researching [Physics]( {{< relref "techs/Physics.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:** Researching the technology costs **55,000 Science** and **5 Unobtainium**.
*   **Activation:** The technology itself enables the Metaphysics system, but upgrades within the system must be purchased using the prestige currency [Paragon]( {{< relref "resource/paragon.md" >}}).

### 2. Strategic Role and Benefits

Metaphysics upgrades are the primary tool for achieving **geometric scaling** in subsequent runs, as they provide permanent bonuses that do not disappear upon reset.

The most effective upgrades generally fall into three categories:

#### A. Price Ratio Reduction (Economic Scaling)

These upgrades decrease the price ratio of structures in the Bonfire tab, meaning the cost of buying subsequent buildings grows much slower. This is one of the most significant benefits, allowing players to build many more structures (and gain more production/population) before hitting storage caps.

The recommended sequence for these early upgrades is:

1.  [Enlightenment]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Enlightenment.md" >}}) (5 Paragon): Reduces all price ratios by 1%.
2.  [Golden Ratio]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Golden_Ratio.md" >}}) (50 Paragon): Reduces price ratios by approximately 1.618%.
3.  **Divine Proportion** (100 Paragon): Reduces price ratios by approximately 1.777%.
4.  **Vitruvian Feline** (250 Paragon): Reduces price ratios by 2%.
5.  **Renaissance** (750 Paragon): Reduces price ratios by 2.25%.

#### B. Progression and Quality of Life (QoL) Upgrades

These upgrades accelerate key production bottlenecks and progression hurdles:

*   [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "Policy/Diplomacy.md" >}}) (5 Paragon): Causes races to be discovered earlier (unlock year reduced from 5 to 1) and with better standing. This is recommended to get early in the game.
*   [Chronomancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Chronomancy.md" >}}) (25 Paragon) and **Astromancy** (50 Paragon): These are useful early QoL upgrades. Chronomancy multiplies the daily chance of meteors and astronomical events by **1.1x**, while Astromancy **doubles** the astronomical event chance and observatory effectiveness (for event chances and auto success rates). This helps mitigate the early **starchart bottleneck**.
*   **Venus of Willenfluff** (150 Paragon) and **Pawgan Rituals** (400 Paragon): These significantly boost the speed at which kittens arrive (75% faster and an additional 150% faster, respectively), which is vital for quick paragon farming runs.
*   [Anachronomancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Anachronomancy.md" >}}) (125 Paragon): **Crucially**, this upgrade ensures that [Time Crystals]( {{< relref "resource/Time_Crystals.md" >}}) and the [Chronophysics]( {{< relref "techs/Chronophysics.md" >}}) technology are saved across resets. This is mandatory before seriously engaging in Time Crystal acquisition.

#### C. Endgame Systems and Prestige

These upgrades enable or significantly boost endgame systems related to time, religion, and unicorns:

*   [Megalomania]( {{< relref "metaphysics/Megalomania.md" >}}) (10 Paragon): Unlocks [Markers]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Marker.md" >}}) and [Black Pyramids]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Black_Pyramid.md" >}}), which are key to starting the **Unicorn/Time crystal Era** and engaging the **Leviathan** trade partner. Megalomania is necessary for refining **Unicorn Tears** into **Black Liquid Sorrow** (BLS).
*   **Numerology** (50 Paragon) and [Numeromancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/numeromancy.md" >}}) (250 Paragon): These enable **Cycles** to affect space production (Numerology) and grant bonuses during festivals based on the current cycle (Numeromancy). The [Redmoon cycle]( {{< relref "Cycles/Redmoon_cycle.md" >}}), when combined with Numeromancy, provides a significant boost to Unobtainium production.
*   **Order of the Void** (75 Paragon): Causes all faith production to also produce 10% of that amount in **Worship**.
*   **Codex** Upgrades (**Vox, Logos, Agrum**): These increase the crafting ratio for manuscripts, compendiums, and blueprints, respectively. Although they are costly, they are not recommended for newer players as their bonuses are minimal compared to the price ratio reductions.

### 3. Progression Strategy

Metaphysics dictates the early **Paragon Grind** phase (Phase 1/Early Game). A player's goal in the first few runs is to accumulate enough Paragon (by resetting with over 70 kittens) to buy the most impactful Metaphysics upgrades.

A suggested goal is to aim for **60 Paragon** on the first reset to buy Diplomacy, Enlightenment, and Golden Ratio, and then **100 Paragon** on the second run to buy Divine Proportion. Once price ratio reductions are secured, you can focus on later QoL upgrades like Chronomancy and Astromancy, and eventually, the endgame technologies like Anachronomancy and Megalomania.
