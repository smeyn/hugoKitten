[Combustion]( {{< relref "techs/Combustion.md" >}}) is a key technology research in the late mid-game of *Kittens Game*, primarily focused on boosting the efficiency of your industrial facilities, particularly manuscript printing and oil production.

### Research Details and Cost

| Category | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prerequisite** | Combustion is unlocked after researching [Industrialization]( {{< relref "techs/Industrialization.md" >}}). |
| **Cost** | Researching Combustion requires **115,000 Science** and **45 Blueprint**. |
| **Next Technology** | Combustion directly unlocks the [Ecology]( {{< relref "techs/Ecology.md" >}}) science. |
| **Progression Path** | This technology is part of the progression toward the Concrete era: Physics $\to$ Electricity $\to$ Industrialization $\to$ [Combustion]( {{< relref "techs/Combustion.md" >}}) or Mechanization. |

### Key Workshop Upgrades

Combustion unlocks three important Workshop upgrades designed to enhance energy and production processes:

1.  [Oil Refinery]( {{< relref "upgrade/Oil_Refinery.md" >}})
    *   This upgrade improves the effectiveness of [Oil Wells]( {{< relref "buildings/Oil_Well.md" >}}) by **35%** (additive with other effects). This is vital for addressing the oil bottleneck as the game progresses.
2.  [Offset Press]( {{< relref "upgrade/Offset_Press.md" >}})
    *   This upgrade significantly boosts the automated production of Manuscripts by [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}). It increases the Printing Press production rate by a factor of 4, raising the output to 0.01 manuscripts per second.
3.  **Fuel Injector**
    *   This upgrade helps mitigate the energy cost of industrialisation by reducing the **coal consumption** of Steamworks by 20%.

### Strategic Context

Combustion is one of the important industrial technologies to target in the mid-game, alongside Metallurgy and Electronics. The upgrades unlocked by Combustion are crucial for maintaining the resource flow necessary for space and high-tier infrastructure development, particularly by improving oil supply for structures like Oil Wells and Kerosene production.
