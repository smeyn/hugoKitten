[Mechanization]( {{< relref "techs/Mechanization.md" >}}) is a key technology research in the mid-to-late game of *Kittens Game*, leading directly to the advanced "Concrete era" of infrastructure development.

Here is a detailed breakdown of its prerequisites, costs, and effects:

### Prerequisites and Cost

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** Mechanization is unlocked after researching [Industrialization]( {{< relref "techs/Industrialization.md" >}}). It is the final step in a major scientific progression path: Physics $\to$ Electricity $\to$ Industrialization $\to$ Mechanization.
*   **Cost:** Researching Mechanization is expensive, requiring **115,000 Science** and **45 Blueprints**.

### Key Unlocks and Effects

Researching Mechanization provides crucial industrial capabilities and new construction materials:

1.  **Resource Unlocked (Concrete):** Mechanization enables the production of [concrete]( {{< relref "craft/Concrete.md" >}}). Concrete is a highly important crafted material necessary for advancing housing and storage infrastructure.
2.  **Building Unlocked (Factory):** This technology unlocks the [Factory]( {{< relref "buildings/Factory.md" >}}) building. Factories are essential for late-game industrial scaling and boosting crafting efficiency.
3.  **Kitten Job Unlocked (Engineer):** Mechanization enables the [Engineer]( {{< relref "job/Engineer.md" >}}) job, allowing kittens to automate crafting processes in the Workshop.
4.  **Workshop Upgrades:** Mechanization unlocks critical efficiency upgrades in the Workshop:
    *   [Concrete Pillars:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Concrete_Pillars.md" >}}) A storage upgrade that increases the maximum capacity of several resources (wood, minerals, iron, coal, gold, and titanium) from Barns, Warehouses, Harbours, and Mints by $+5\%$.
    *   [Pumpjack:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Pumpjack.md" >}}) This upgrade improves the effectiveness of [Oil Wells]( {{< relref "buildings/Oil_Well.md" >}}) by $45\%$ and enables their automation, although Oil Wells will then consume 1 Watt of energy each.

### Strategic Significance

Mechanization is a major checkpoint on the path to high-tier buildings and population management:

*   **Concrete Era:** This research is necessary for achieving [Concrete Huts]( {{< relref "upgrade/Concrete_Huts.md" >}}). Concrete Huts require a tremendous amount of titanium and grant a major reduction in the price ratio of Huts, making population expansion cheaper.
*   **Technological Progression:** Mechanization directly unlocks the next tier of science, [Electronics]( {{< relref "techs/Electronics.md" >}}).
*   **Endgame Focus:** While the costs for Mechanization are high, players are advised to pre-emptively grind for the huge amount of [titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) required for the subsequent Concrete upgrades, as this process will often provide most of the blueprints needed to research Mechanization itself through trade bonuses.
