[Mathematics]( {{< relref "techs/Mathematics.md" >}}) is a crucial early-to-mid-game technology in *Kittens Game*, primarily focused on expanding your scientific capacity and unlocking the [Academy]( {{< relref "buildings/Academy.md" >}}) building.

### Technology Overview

| Detail | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | 1000 Science,. |
| **Prerequisite** | Unlocked by [Animal Husbandry]( {{< relref "techs/Animal_Husbandry.md" >}}),. |
| **Unlocks** | [Academy]( {{< relref "buildings/Academy.md" >}}) (building),; [Celestial Mechanics]( {{< relref "upgrade/Celestial_Mechanics.md" >}}) (workshop upgrade),. |

### The Academy Building

The Academy is the key building unlocked by this research, offering significant bonuses to science and culture accumulation:

*   **Cost:** 50 Wood, 70 Minerals, and 100 Science.
*   **Primary Effects:**
    *   **Science Boost:** Provides a **+20% Science** bonus.
    *   **Science Storage:** Increases maximum Science storage by **+500**,.
    *   **Culture Storage:** Increases maximum Culture capacity by **+25**.
    *   **Kitten Experience:** Provides a **+5% Kitten Exp** bonus.

### Strategic Role

Mathematics is considered "especially useful" because of the Academy's ability to boost science accumulation and support the cultural infrastructure.

1.  **Accelerating Science:** Academies directly increase science output and significantly boost maximum science capacity,. Along with Libraries, Academies are key buildings for increasing the culture cap, which is necessary for crafting Manuscripts.
2.  **Trade Prerequisite:** Academies contribute to increasing your culture cap, which is a requirement for unlocking the [Nagas]( {{< relref "trade/Nagas.md" >}}) trade partner (requiring 1500 culture cap),,.
3.  **Iron Will Mode:** In the resource-constrained Iron Will mode, [Mathematics]( {{< relref "techs/Mathematics.md" >}}) is a crucial early research. It unlocks the [Celestial Mechanics]( {{< relref "upgrade/Celestial_Mechanics.md" >}}) upgrade (costing 250 Science), which increases the science gained from celestial events and meteors by **60%**,. Since astronomical events and meteors are the *only* initial sources of Science and Minerals, respectively, in Iron Will mode, this boost is essential for early progression,,.
