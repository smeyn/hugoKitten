[Archery]( {{< relref "techs/Archery.md" >}}) is a fundamental early-game scientific technology that serves as the gateway to the hunt system, rare resource acquisition, and the specialised Iron Will progression path. It costs **300 Science** and is unlocked after researching [Agriculture]( {{< relref "techs/Agriculture.md" >}}).

### **Core Unlocks and Mechanics**
Researching Archery introduces several critical components to the colony's development:
*   **The Hunter Job:** This technology enables you to assign kittens as Hunters, who produce **0.06 catpower per tick**.
*   **The Hunt System:** Once you have accumulated **100 catpower**, you can send your kittens on a hunt. This is the primary method for obtaining rare resources like [Furs]( {{< relref "resource/Fur.md" >}}) and [Ivory]( {{< relref "resource/ivory.md" >}}), and it offers a 5% chance to find **Unicorns**.
*   **Technological Branching:** Archery is the mandatory prerequisite for [Animal Husbandry]( {{< relref "techs/Animal_Husbandry.md" >}}), which leads to housing improvements and the "Unicorn Tree".
*   **Zebra Buildings:** For advanced players, Archery unlocks Zebra-specific structures including the [Zebra Outpost]( {{< relref "buildings/Zebra_Outpost.md" >}}), [Zebra Workshop]( {{< relref "buildings/Zebra_Workshop.md" >}}), and [Zebra Forge]( {{< relref "buildings/Zebra_Forge.md" >}}).

### **Workshop Enhancements**
The effectiveness of the systems unlocked by Archery can be drastically improved through specific Workshop upgrades:
*   **Catpower Production:** You can boost the rate at which Hunters generate catpower using the **Composite Bow (+50%)**, **Crossbow (+25%)**, and **Railgun (+25%)**.
*   **Hunting Bonuses:** To increase the yield of Furs and Ivory per hunt, you can research various tiers of gear, starting with **Bolas (+1.0)** and **Hunting Armour (+2.0)**, followed by smaller increments from [Steel Armour]( {{< relref "upgrade/Steel_Armour.md" >}}), [Alloy Armour]( {{< relref "upgrade/Alloy_Armour.md" >}}), and [Nanosuits]( {{< relref "upgrade/Nanosuits.md" >}}). These bonuses are additive.

### **Strategic Utility**
In the early game, there is often a choice between researching **Archery or Mining**. Most strategic guides recommend prioritising [Mining]( {{< relref "techs/Mining.md" >}}) first, as hunting starts very weak and the colony initially lacks the spare kittens to compensate for the rapid consumption of Furs and Ivory. However, hunting is essential long-term because Furs and Ivory provide a **+10% happiness boost**, which improves the overall production efficiency of all kittens.

### **Iron Will and Zebra Accumulation**
Archery is the **strategic pivot point** for the specialised "Iron Will" (IW) mode, where the player progresses without any kitten housing:
*   **Zebra Discovery:** In IW mode, Zebras serve as the primary source of catpower (acting as passive Hunters) and begin to appear only after Archery is researched.
*   **The Reset Loop:** A common strategy involves researching Archery and then **immediately resetting** the game. Doing this while in Iron Will increases your **maximum Zebra limit** for the next run.
*   **Prestige Setup:** Players often perform 6 to 10 of these short "Archery resets" to accumulate **50–60 Zebras**. This provides a permanent, efficient catpower source that bypasses the need to feed kittens, significantly accelerating mid-game economic stability.
