[Acoustics]( {{< relref "techs/Acoustics.md" >}}) is a crucial mid-game technology research that advances your religious and cultural infrastructure by enabling the construction of the [Chapel]( {{< relref "buildings/Chapel.md" >}}) building.

### 1. Unlocking and Cost

*   **Prerequisite:** Acoustics is unlocked after successfully researching [Architecture]( {{< relref "techs/Architecture.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:** Researching Acoustics requires **60,000 Science** and **60 Compendiums**.
*   **Progression:** This technology is part of the progression pathway following Navigation and Architecture. Acoustics subsequently unlocks [Drama and Poetry]( {{< relref "techs/Drama_and_Poetry.md" >}}) research.

### 2. Key Building Unlocked: Chapel

The primary function of Acoustics is to unlock the [Chapel]( {{< relref "buildings/Chapel.md" >}}) building, which significantly improves the rate of faith accumulation.

| Building | Cost | Effects |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Chapel]( {{< relref "buildings/Chapel.md" >}}) | 2000 Minerals, 250 Culture, 250 Parchment | Generates **+0.005 Faith per Tick** (a higher rate than the 0.0015 faith per tick generated by Temples). Also generates **+0.05 Culture per Tick** and increases **Max Culture by +200**. |

### 3. Strategic Importance

Acoustics is strategically important because it addresses two major resource bottlenecks in the mid-game:

*   **Faith and Culture:** Acoustics improves **faith and culture production**, which are resources that accumulate slowly. Chapels provide a substantial increase to faith generation compared to the prior Temple building.
*   **Mid-Game Choices:** When facing the choice between advanced sciences unlocked after Navigation (Chemistry, Acoustics, Geology, Electricity), experts generally recommend pursuing Acoustics to boost the crucial, slower-generating faith and culture resources. This is key for advancing through technologies like [Theology]( {{< relref "science/theology.md" >}}) and later, the **Religion** tab upgrades.
