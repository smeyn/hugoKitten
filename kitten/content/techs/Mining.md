[Mining]( {{< relref "techs/Mining.md" >}}) is a crucial early-game technology research in *Kittens Game*, foundational to developing your industrial economy by unlocking the Miner profession and the Mine building, which produce **Minerals**.

### Unlocking and Costs

*   **Prerequisite:** Mining is unlocked after researching [Agriculture]( {{< relref "techs/Agriculture.md" >}}) (100 Science).
*   **Cost:** Researching Mining requires **500 Science**.

### Effects and Functionality

Mining enables kittens to produce minerals and unlocks critical early buildings and effects:

*   **Job Unlocked:** It unlocks the [Miner]( {{< relref "job/Miner.md" >}}) job, allowing kittens to accumulate **Minerals** at a base rate of **+0.05 Minerals per Tick**.
*   **Building Unlocked:** It unlocks the [Mine]( {{< relref "buildings/Mine.md" >}}) building.
    *   Mines cost **100 Wood** to build and have a price ratio of 1.15.
    *   Each Mine provides a **+20% Minerals** bonus.
*   **Resource Source:** Mining enables **Meteors**, which are events that grant a small, automatic boost to your **Minerals**.
*   **Workshop Upgrade:** It unlocks the [Bolas]( {{< relref "upgrade/Bolas.md" >}}) Workshop upgrade, which improves hunting effectiveness.

### Strategic Significance (Early Game)

Mining is essential for transitioning from a simple catnip and wood economy to one capable of producing processed materials:

*   **Mineral Access:** Minerals become **increasingly important for advanced buildings**. Mining allows you to secure a consistent supply of Minerals early on.
*   **Progression Path:** Mining is typically researched after Agriculture, along with [Archery]( {{< relref "techs/Archery.md" >}}). While Hunting (unlocked by Archery) starts weak, Mining immediately yields a useful amount of Minerals, even with a single Miner.
*   **Next Technology:** Mining unlocks [Metal Working]( {{< relref "techs/Metal_Working.md" >}}), which is necessary to build [Smelters]( {{< relref "buildings/Smelter.md" >}}) for converting Minerals into **Iron**.
*   **Policy Conflict:** Mining also unlocks the [Strip Mining]( {{< relref "Policy/Strip_Mining.md" >}}) environmental policy (costing 2000 Science), which increases mineral production by 30% but adds 5% pollution and incurs a -2% happiness penalty.

### Interactions in Iron Will Mode

In the self-imposed restriction mode, **Iron Will** (where housing cannot be built), Mining is essential for gaining minerals:

*   **Mineral Source:** In Iron Will mode, **meteors** that appear after researching Mining are one of the *only* initial ways to gain **Minerals**. Building more Mines increases the Mineral bonus received from these meteors.
*   **Policy Effect:** The [Strip Mining]( {{< relref "Policy/Strip_Mining.md" >}}) policy is highly recommended in Iron Will mode because it grants a **+10% bonus minerals from meteors**.
*   [Coal Production:]( {{< relref "resource/coal_production.md" >}}) The [Deep Mining]( {{< relref "upgrade/Deep_Mining.md" >}}) upgrade (unlocked by [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}})) allows Mines to produce **0.003 Coal per Tick**.
