[Metallurgy]( {{< relref "techs/Metallurgy.md" >}}) is a mid-game technology research that is unlocked by [Industrialization]( {{< relref "techs/Industrialization.md" >}}) and provides valuable workshop upgrades focused on boosting the efficiency and output of metal production and refinement processes.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Metallurgy technology:

### Unlocking and Cost

*   **Prerequisite:** Metallurgy is unlocked after researching [Industrialization]( {{< relref "techs/Industrialization.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:** Researching Metallurgy requires **125,000 Science** and **60 Blueprints**.

### Key Workshop Upgrades

Metallurgy is primarily important for the upgrades it provides to metal processing buildings like Smelters and Calciners. These upgrades help manage the mid-game requirement for processed metals and alloys:

1.  [Electrolytic Smelting:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Electrolytic_Smelting.md" >}}) This upgrade effectively doubles the production rate of [Smelters]( {{< relref "buildings/Smelter.md" >}}), making them produce **+95% more iron and coal**.
2.  [Oxidation:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Oxidation.md" >}}) This significantly boosts the output of [Calciners]( {{< relref "buildings/Calciner.md" >}}). Calciners produce **+95% more iron** and a substantial **+285% more titanium**.
3.  [Mining Drill:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Mining_Drill.md" >}}) This upgrade improves the effectiveness of [Geologists]( {{< relref "job/Geologist.md" >}}). Geologists, if the prerequisite [Geodesy]( {{< relref "upgrade/Geodesy.md" >}}) upgrade has been researched, gain an additional **+0.01 coal/tick** and **+0.0005 gold/tick**. This upgrade costs **100,000 Science**, **1750 Titanium**, and **750 Steel**.

### Strategic Context

*   **Industrial Path:** Metallurgy is part of the industrial expansion pathway, which follows Electricity and Industrialization. This pathway eventually leads to the Mechanization and Electronics branches.
*   **Titanium Production:** The [Oxidation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Oxidation.md" >}}) upgrade is crucial in the mid-game for significantly accelerating titanium production from Calciners, helping the player acquire the necessary volume of titanium for advanced structures.
*   **Kitten Trait:** In addition to the research, kittens can have the **Metallurgist** trait. When assigned as a leader, this trait increases **metal crafting efficiency** by adding a **+0.1 craft ratio** for **plate, steel, gear, and alloy**.
