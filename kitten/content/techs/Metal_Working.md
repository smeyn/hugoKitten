[Metal Working]( {{< relref "techs/Metal_Working.md" >}}) is an important early technology in *Kittens Game*, serving as a prerequisite for smelting mineral resources into processed materials like iron and gold.

Here is a detailed breakdown of Metal Working:

### 1. Unlocking and Cost

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** Metal Working is unlocked after researching [Mining]( {{< relref "techs/Mining.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:** Researching Metal Working costs **900 Science**.

### 2. Buildings and Resources Unlocked

Researching this technology unlocks the basic structure necessary for converting raw minerals into metal resources:

*   **Building Unlocked:** Metal Working unlocks the [Smelter]( {{< relref "buildings/Smelter.md" >}}) building.
    *   The Smelter converts raw resources, consuming **0.05 Wood per Tick** and **0.1 Minerals per Tick** to produce **0.02 Iron per Tick**.
    *   Smelters can be further upgraded with [Gold Ore]( {{< relref "upgrade/Gold_Ore.md" >}}) to produce **0.001 Gold per Tick**. This means that a small percentage of ore will be smelted into gold.
*   **Workshop Upgrade:** Metal Working unlocks the [Hunting Armour]( {{< relref "upgrade/Hunting_Armour.md" >}}) Workshop upgrade. Hunting Armour provides a **+2.0 Hunting bonus**, making hunters three times as effective (an increase of about 165-200% of the basic fur and ivory hunting amounts).

### 3. Strategic Role

Metal Working is a critical early-game step for expanding resource production and moving toward industrialisation:

*   **Iron Production:** This technology is essential because **Minerals become increasingly important** for advanced buildings. Metal Working allows you to put your minerals to work by building Smelters to create **Iron**.
*   **Production Trade-off:** While beneficial for accessing Iron and Gold, building Smelters requires converting minerals and wood, so players must bear in mind that creating Iron will **reduce your Wood and Mineral stores**.
*   **Lumber Mill Prerequisite:** The subsequent technology that boosts wood production, the [Lumber Mill]( {{< relref "buildings/Lumber_Mill.md" >}}), requires Iron for construction, meaning Metal Working must be researched first.
*   **Iron Will Mode:** In Iron Will mode, after Gold Ore is researched, Hunting produces Gold, which is important since kittens cannot be employed as Geologists for gold production in this mode.

Metal Working is a mandatory step in the "Basic Resource Rotation" necessary for establishing a strong economic foundation by processing basic resources into advanced components.
