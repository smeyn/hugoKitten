The query is about **Cryptotheology**, which is both a specific high-tier technology and the name of the system it unlocks in *Kittens Game*, defining the **Phase 3** or End Game progression.

Here is a comprehensive overview of Cryptotheology, its purpose, and its related elements based on the sources:

### 1. Cryptotheology as a Technology

*   **Unlock Requirement:** The technology **Cryptotheology** is unlocked after researching **Theology** and costs **650K Science** and **5 Relics** [1, 2].
*   **Effect:** Researching this technology grants access to the Cryptotheology system and unlocks the **Relic Station** upgrade [2, 3].
*   **Persistence:** The technology itself **does not carry over** when you reset the game, even though the buildings purchased within the Cryptotheology system *do* persist across resets [3].

### 2. The Cryptotheology System (Phase 3)

Cryptotheology is described as the system that provides "Insights into the mysteries of time and space" and focuses on the **Time, Relics, and Void** mechanics of the game [3, 4]. It is the defining feature of the **Phase 3** (End Game) of *Kittens Game* [4].

The core purpose of the system is to purchase permanent, powerful structures using **Relics** and **Void**, which often scale with the player's **Transcendence Tiers (TT)**.

### 3. Buildings and Upgrades

Cryptotheology buildings purchased persist across resets and are unlocked sequentially based on your Transcendence Tier (TT), which is bought with **Epiphany** [3, 5].

| Building/Upgrade | Primary Cost | Transcendence Prerequisite | Primary Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Black Obelisk** | 100 Relics | TT 1 | Improves your **Solar Revolution** bonus cap by +5% per Transcendence Tier [5]. |
| **Black Nexus** | 5,000 Relics | TT 3 | Improves relic production from two sources: **Refining Time Crystals** (1 + (Black Nexus \* Black Pyramid) relics) and **Relic Station** upgraded Space Beacons [5]. |
| **Black Core** | 10,000 Relics | TT 5 | Increases the **Sorrow** (Black Liquid Sorrow or BLS) limit by +1% [6, 7]. |
| **Event Horizon** | 25,000 Relics | TT 7 | Increases **global resource storage ratio** by **+10%**. This stacks additively with Void Rifts and multiplicatively with other storage bonuses [6, 8]. |
| **Black Library** | 30,000 Relics | TT 9 | Improves **Codex Leviathanianus** scaling by +2% per library, further boosted by Unicorn Graveyards [6]. |
| **Black Radiance** | 37,500 Relics | TT 12 | Increases the **alicorn corruption rate** based on the amount of Sorrow (BLS) and the number of Black Radiances [6]. |
| **Blazar** | 50,000 Relics | TT 15 | Improves **Chronomancy** and **Unicornmancy** by 2.5%, **Time Impedance** by 10%, and **Resource Retrieval** effectiveness by 2% [9]. Blazars are vital to a Time Crystal engine [10]. |
| **Dark Nova** | 75,000 Relics, 7,500 Void | TT 20 | Provides a **+2% global energy production** bonus [9]. |
| **Mausoleum** | 50,000 Relics, 12,500 Void, 10 Necrocorn | TT 23 | Unlocks the ability to purchase **Pacts** [9, 11]. |
| **Holy Genocide** | 100,000 Relics, 25,000 Void | TT 25 | Unlocks the **Post Apocalypse** challenge upon reset [9]. |

### 4. Strategic Role and Goals

*   **Relic Conversion:** Cryptotheology provides direct use for **Relics**, which are primarily created by refining **Time Crystals** (25 TCs = 1 Relic) [12].
*   **Late-Game Gate:** Once a player can build Eludium Huts easily, they are ready for the unicorn/time crystal phase. The next major goal is to maximize the **Solar Revolution bonus** (capped at 1000% before Cryptotheology upgrades) and reach **Transcendence Tier 15** [13, 14]. Reaching TT 15 is necessary to purchase the **Blazar**, which is considered vital to a Time Crystal engine [10, 15].
*   **Boosting Persistence:** Cryptotheology buildings are key to late-game scaling. For example, **Black Obelisks** boost the cap of the Solar Revolution bonus [5].
*   **Challenges:** The ultimate building, the **Holy Genocide**, is required to unlock the **Post Apocalypse** challenge [9].
