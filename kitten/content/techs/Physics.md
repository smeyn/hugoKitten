[Physics]( {{< relref "techs/Physics.md" >}}) is a crucial mid-game technology research that opens up highly advanced industrial and temporal mechanics, setting the stage for the transition into the titanium and space eras.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Physics technology:

### Unlocking and Cost

*   **Prerequisite:** Physics is unlocked after researching [Navigation]( {{< relref "techs/Navigation.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:** Researching Physics requires **50,000 Science** and **35 Compendiums**.

### Strategic Importance and Subsequent Research

Physics is a key stepping stone in the scientific progression, particularly because it enables the construction of high-tier industrial buildings and unlocks critical next-tier science branches.

*   **Technology Unlocks:** Physics immediately unlocks three advanced sciences:
    1.  [Chemistry]( {{< relref "techs/Chemistry.md" >}})
    2.  [Electricity]( {{< relref "techs/Electricity.md" >}})
    3.  [Metaphysics]( {{< relref "techs/Metaphysics.md" >}})
*   **Industrial Path:** Physics is the first step in the crucial path toward the **Concrete era**. This path continues through [Electricity]( {{< relref "techs/Electricity.md" >}}) $\to$ Industrialization $\to$ Mechanization, which ultimately unlocks the [Factory]( {{< relref "buildings/Factory.md" >}}) building and the ability to craft [Concrete]( {{< relref "craft/Concrete.md" >}}).
*   **Space Transition:** Physics is a prerequisite on the path to [Rocketry]( {{< relref "techs/Rocketry.md" >}}), which is necessary to access the **Space tab**.

### Upgrades and Resources Unlocked

*   **Craftable Resource:** Researching Physics enables the ability to craft [Blueprints]( {{< relref "resource/Blueprint.md" >}}). Blueprints are essential for constructing advanced industrial and utility buildings like Steamworks and Reactors.
*   **Workshop Upgrades:** Physics unlocks several valuable Workshop upgrades:
    *   [Steel Saw:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Steel_Saw.md" >}}) Improves Lumber Mill efficiency by an additional **+20%**.
    *   [Pyrolysis:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Pyrolysis.md" >}}) Boosts Coal output by **+20%** (multiplies with other effects, though Smelters are unaffected).
    *   [Pneumatic Press:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Pneumatic_Press.md" >}}) Expands Steamworks automation to include converting **iron to plates** when resources cap out.

### Context in the Progression Loop

The decision to research Physics is part of the move past the [Theology]( {{< relref "science/theology.md" >}}) and [Astronomy]( {{< relref "techs/Astronomy.md" >}}) hurdle. Once unlocked, Physics leads into a phase where the player focuses on generating the titanium needed for construction and acquiring [Blueprints]( {{< relref "resource/Blueprint.md" >}}) (which are convertible from Compendiums after Physics is researched) for technology advancements. Players focused on paragon farming often prioritize this research path to accelerate technological development.
