[Navigation]( {{< relref "techs/Navigation.md" >}}) is a pivotal technology in *Kittens Game*, marking the transition into the trade and titanium accumulation phase by unlocking essential infrastructure, advanced crafting, and further scientific branches.

### Technological Details

*   **Prerequisite and Cost:** Navigation is unlocked by researching [Astronomy]( {{< relref "techs/Astronomy.md" >}}). Researching it requires **35,000 Science** and **100 Manuscript**.
*   **Scientific Path:** Successfully researching Navigation unlocks the next three critical technology branches: **Architecture, Physics, and Geology**.
*   **Strategic Timing:** Players are advised to research **Navigation Science** once they have accumulated **25 Starcharts**. The policy [Clear Cutting]( {{< relref "Policy/Clear_Cutting.md" >}}) is often recommended beforehand to provide the necessary **Wood** for the buildings and ships unlocked by Navigation.

### Key Unlocks

Navigation introduces the ability to build advanced transportation and storage structures:

#### 1. Trade and Crafting
Navigation enables the crafting of [Trade Ships]( {{< relref "craft/Trade_Ship.md" >}}).

*   [Trade Ships]( {{< relref "craft/Trade_Ship.md" >}}) are essential for discovering new civilizations through the "Explore" function.
*   Trade Ships are critical for reaching the **Titanium era**, as they are the major upgrade for obtaining more [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}) through trading with [Zebras]( {{< relref "trade/zebras.md" >}}).
*   Crafting a Trade Ship initially requires **100 Scaffold**, **150 Plate**, and **25 Starchart**.

#### 2. Building Unlocks
Navigation unlocks the [Harbour]( {{< relref "buildings/Harbour.md" >}}) building.

*   Harbours provide substantial increases to storage capacity for several key common resources:
    *   **Catnip:** +2500.
    *   **Wood, Minerals, Iron, Coal, Gold, and Titanium** storage limits are all increased.
    *   The [Expanded Cargo]( {{< relref "upgrade/Expanded_Cargo.md" >}}) upgrade (unlocked by Navigation) further increases Harbour capacity by **1% per trade ship**, up to a limit of 225%.

#### 3. Workshop Upgrades
The technology also unlocks several important Workshop upgrades focused on resource efficiency and trade relations:

*   [Caravanserai:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Caravanserai.md" >}}) This upgrade improves race relations by giving each [Tradepost]( {{< relref "buildings/Tradepost.md" >}}) a flat **0.35% chance decrease to the hostile event probability** and a **0.175% increase to the friendly event probability**.
*   [Titanium Axe:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Titanium_Axe.md" >}}) Improves Woodcutters' output by **50%**.
*   [Astrolabe:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Astrolabe.md" >}}) Improves [Observatory]( {{< relref "buildings/Observatory.md" >}}) effectiveness.
*   [Titanium Reflectors:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Titanium_Reflectors.md" >}}) Increases the maximum science storage bonus derived from Libraries/Data Centers based on the number of Observatories you have.

Navigation acts as a necessary gateway, like plotting a course to a new continent, enabling the building of the ships (Trade Ships) and port infrastructure (Harbours) needed to access lucrative resources (Titanium and Iron) from distant, often hostile, civilizations.
