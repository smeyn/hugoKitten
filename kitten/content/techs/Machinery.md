[Machinery]( {{< relref "science/machinery.md" >}}) is a crucial mid-game technology research in *Kittens Game*, enabling automated production and unlocking the specialized [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}) building.

### Unlocking and Cost

*   **Prerequisite Technology:** Machinery is unlocked by researching [Writing]( {{< relref "techs/Writing.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:** Researching Machinery requires **15,000 Science**.
*   **Strategic Context:** Machinery is one of three major sciences unlocked by Writing, alongside Philosophy and Steel. Compared to Philosophy (which leads directly to Theology and further advancement), Machinery is initially viewed as a "specialist Tech that won’t help you much right now".

### Key Unlocks and Effects

Researching Machinery is essential for advancing industrial automation and resource production:

1.  **Buildings:** Machinery unlocks the [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}) building. Steamworks require [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) (65 units), [Gear]( {{< relref "craft/Gear.md" >}}) (20 units), and [Blueprint]( {{< relref "resource/Blueprint.md" >}}) (1 unit) to construct.

2.  **Upgrades:** Machinery unlocks several key Workshop upgrades:
    *   [Printing Press:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Printing_Press.md" >}}) Allows Steamworks to automatically produce Manuscripts. This provides an alternative pathway for resource acquisition, as manually getting Manuscripts requires hunting Furs for Parchment and accumulating Culture.
    *   [Workshop Automation:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Workshop_Automation.md" >}}) Causes Steamworks to convert specific basic resources (Wood to Beams, Minerals to Slabs) when those resources are near their storage cap.
    *   [Crossbow:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Crossbow.md" >}}) A permanent upgrade that boosts Catpower production from Hunters.

### Strategic Significance (Steamworks)

The primary strategic importance of Machinery lies in the capabilities of the Steamworks:

*   **Manuscript Automation:** Steamworks, when paired with the [Printing Press]( {{< relref "upgrade/Printing_Press.md" >}}) upgrade, consume Coal to automatically print manuscripts. This is helpful for overcoming the "fair bump" or hurdle presented by the high Manuscript requirements for advancing science (like Theology).
*   **Energy and Boost:** Steamworks provide **+1 Energy** and a significant **+15% Magneto Boost**.
*   **Cost Management:** Steamworks present a secondary hurdle because they require [Blueprints]( {{< relref "resource/Blueprint.md" >}}) to create, which often requires trading until their production cost can be managed.
