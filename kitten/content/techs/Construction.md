[Construction]( {{< relref "techs/Construction.md" >}}) is a critical early-to- mid-game technology research that fundamentally transforms your village by introducing new resource management tools and advanced housing options. It is essential for continuing scientific progression and scaling your infrastructure.

### Technology Details

| Category | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | 1300 Science. |
| **Prerequisite** | Unlocked by [Animal Husbandry]( {{< relref "techs/Animal_Husbandry.md" >}}). |
| **Unlocks** | [Engineering]( {{< relref "techs/Engineering.md" >}}) (next research). |

### Key Buildings Unlocked

Researching Construction unlocks four key buildings that help expand your village capabilities:

1.  [Log House:]( {{< relref "buildings/Log_House.md" >}}) This is a tier-up housing structure that costs 200 Wood and 250 Minerals. It provides **+1 maximum kitten** and **+50 maximum catpower**. Log Houses are often prioritised early to continue maximizing population.
2.  [Lumber Mill:]( {{< relref "buildings/Lumber_Mill.md" >}}) This industrial structure costs 100 Wood, 50 Iron, and 250 Minerals. It increases **Wood production by +10%**.
3.  [Warehouse:]( {{< relref "buildings/Warehouse.md" >}}) This is an important storage building costing 1.5 Beam and 2 Slab. Warehouses initially do not store Catnip but increase the maximum limits of Wood, Minerals, Iron, Coal, Gold, and Titanium. They eventually upgrade to **Spaceports**.
4.  [Ziggurat:]( {{< relref "buildings/Ziggurat.md" >}}) This is a mega-structure building that serves as a prerequisite for the **Unicorn/Time Crystal Era**. It costs 50 Megalith, 50 Scaffold, and 1 Blueprint and increases **Max Culture by +8%**.

### Effects and Strategic Importance

The research also provides crucial operational enhancements:

*   **Enables Crafting:** Construction formally **enables crafting** operations in the Workshop. This allows basic resource inputs to be converted into complex materials.
*   **Workshop Upgrades:** It unlocks several useful upgrades:
    *   [Composite Bow:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Composite_Bow.md" >}}) Provides a permanent **+50% boost to Catpower production** from Hunters.
    *   [Catnip Enrichment:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Catnip_Enrichment.md" >}}) Improves Catnip refinement efficiency by reducing the cost of wood crafting from 100 Catnip to 50 Catnip.
    *   [Reinforced Saw:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Reinforced_Saw.md" >}}) Improves Lumber Mill efficiency by an additional +20%.

Strategically, players are advised to **push for Construction science** early to establish Log Houses for population growth and Lumber Mills to improve wood output, as wood accumulates slowly before this point.

As a general action, commencing **construction on a civilization** begins when you start gathering catnip to expand the game. Buildings are often kept hidden until you have at least 30% of the necessary resources to construct the first one.
