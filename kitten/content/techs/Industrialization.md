+++
**Industrialisation** is a mid-game technology that marks a major shift from basic resource gathering to advanced manufacturing and efficiency,. It is unlocked by researching **Electricity** and requires **100,000 Science and 25 Blueprints** to purchase,.

### **Technological Unlocks**
Researching Industrialisation is a prerequisite for several critical advancement paths:
*   **Technologies:** It unlocks **Mechanization** (which enables Factories and Engineers), **Metallurgy** (which improves metal production), and **Combustion** (which enables Oil Refineries and higher oil throughput),.
*   **Workshop Upgrades:** Three specific efficiency upgrades become available:
    *   **Barges:** Increases the **maximum coal storage from Harbours by 50%**, which is vital for maintaining steel production and Steamworks,.
    *   **Advanced Automation:** Increases the frequency of **Workshop Automation** from once per year to **twice per year**, helping to prevent resource caps from halting production,.
    *   **Logistics:** Increases the effectiveness of **kitten skills by 15%**, providing a global multiplicative boost to productivity across all jobs.

### **The "Full Industrialization" Policy**
Once Industrialisation is researched and the player has established at least one **Factory**, the **Full Industrialization** policy can be enacted,.
*   **Requirements:** Costs **10,000 Culture** and requires the player to have already chosen either **Strip Mining** or **Clear Cutting** as an environmental policy,.
*   **Effects:** It increases the effectiveness of Factories, making their crafting bonus **5% more powerful**.
*   **Drawbacks:** It adds **+5% to pollution** levels,.
*   **Strategy:** Strategic advice generally suggests that Full Industrialization is the **"obvious pick"** from the second game run onwards, as the crafting boost outweighs the pollution penalty in most scenarios.

### **Strategic Progression**
Industrialisation serves as a mandatory gate for reaching the **Concrete era** and eventually **Space**,. The tech path typically follows **Physics → Electricity → Industrialisation → Mechanization**. 

This phase is critical because it allows the player to overcome **bottlenecks in Titanium and Blueprints** through more efficient trading and crafting systems,. Enacting policies like Full Industrialization, when combined with **Communism**, can significantly boost the industry's throughput for **Iron, Coal, and Titanium**, which are the primary requirements for mid-to-late-game infrastructure,. Furthermore, the science cap required for following technologies, such as Mechanization (115k Science) and Electronics (135k Science), necessitates the expanded storage and production capabilities that Industrialisation-related upgrades provide,,.
