[Biochemistry]( {{< relref "techs/Biochemistry.md" >}}) is an advanced scientific technology research in *Kittens Game*, situated on the technology tree after Biology. It is essential for unlocking critical infrastructure related to **oil production and catnip refinement**.

Here is a breakdown of the technology:

### Unlocking and Cost

*   **Prerequisite:** Biochemistry is unlocked by successfully researching [Biology]( {{< relref "techs/Biology.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:** Researching Biochemistry requires a high amount of resources: **145,000 Science** and **500 Compendiums**.

### Key Unlocks and Effects

Researching Biochemistry opens access to the next scientific field and provides a crucial Workshop upgrade:

1.  **Next Technology:** Biochemistry unlocks [Genetics]( {{< relref "techs/Genetics.md" >}}).
2.  **Workshop Upgrade (Biofuel Processing):** The research enables the [Biofuel Processing]( {{< relref "upgrade/Biofuel_Processing.md" >}}) Workshop upgrade. This upgrade provides a significant functional benefit to the [Bio Lab]( {{< relref "buildings/Bio_Lab.md" >}}) building (unlocked by Biology).
    *   Bio Labs, with the Biofuel Processing upgrade, can automatically convert **catnip into oil**.
    *   This conversion consumes **5 catnip per second** (or 1 catnip per tick), and uses **1 Watt of Energy**.
    *   In exchange, the Bio Lab produces **0.10 oil per second** (or 0.02 oil per tick),.

### Strategic Significance

Biochemistry plays a critical role in mitigating the **oil production bottleneck** in the late mid-game, particularly for players facing resource constraints or engaging in specialized runs:

*   **Oil Supply:** By enabling Bio Labs to convert catnip to oil, Biochemistry helps players utilize massive catnip surpluses to generate industrial fuel. Oil is a common resource needed for structures like [Oil Wells]( {{< relref "buildings/Oil_Well.md" >}}), [Calciners]( {{< relref "buildings/Calciner.md" >}}), and [Kerosene]( {{< relref "resource/kerosene.md" >}}) production,,.
*   **Kerosene Production:** The Oil Processing technology, unlocked by Rocketry, enables the production of [Kerosene]( {{< relref "resource/kerosene.md" >}}). Kerosene is a crucial fuel for space missions (like Dune Mission and Moon Mission) and the Orbital Array,,. A steady supply of oil via Biofuel Processing is fundamental to maintaining Kerosene production velocity.
*   **Production Scaling:** The subsequent research unlocked by Genetics is the [GM Catnip]( {{< relref "upgrade/GM_Catnip.md" >}}) upgrade, which further improves the oil yield from Bio Labs by **60%**,.
*   **Run Planning:** Due to the high science and compendium costs, the [Biology]( {{< relref "techs/Biology.md" >}}) research pathway (which leads to Biochemistry) is sometimes advised to be skipped in initial runs until players can easily craft [Alloy]( {{< relref "craft/Alloy.md" >}}).
