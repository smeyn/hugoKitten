**Exogeology** is a key mid-to-late-game science technology that is essential for unlocking advanced storage capacity, new building materials, and the next tier of housing upgrades.

### 1. Prerequisites and Cost

*   **Unlocking:** Exogeology is unlocked after successfully researching **Orbital Engineering** [1]
*   **Cost:** To research Exogeology, you must pay **275K Science** and **250 Blueprints** [1].

### 2. Unlocks and Follow-up Science

Researching Exogeology unlocks several crucial elements and leads directly to the next phase of high-tier crafting:

*   **Next Science Tier:** It unlocks **Exometallurgy** (formerly Advanced Exogeology), which is the science required to enable the crafting of **Eludium** [2].
*   **Housing Upgrade:** It unlocks the **Unobtainium Huts** upgrade [1]. This upgrade requires **200K Science**, **350 Unobtainium**, and **15K Titanium**, and reduces the Hut price ratio by 25% [3].
*   **Storage and Production Upgrades:** It unlocks several specialized Workshop upgrades [1]:
    *   **Unobtainium Reflectors:** These improve telescope reflectors, increasing the maximum science bonus gained from Observatories by an additional 2% per Observatory [4].
    *   **Unobtainium Drill:** This improves the effectiveness of **Geologists** [4].
    *   **Hydro Plant Turbines:** This upgrade makes Hydro Plants 15% more effective (increasing energy output from 5 Wt to 5.75 Wt) [4].
    *   **Storage Bunkers:** This is a vital storage upgrade that increases the maximum storage limit for wood, minerals, coal, iron, gold, and titanium from Warehouses, Barns, Harbors, and Mints by **20%** [5]. The storage bunkers upgrade requires **25K Science**, **500 Unobtainium**, and **1250 Concrete** [5].

### 3. Strategic Importance (The Unobtainium Era)

Exogeology marks the beginning of the "Unobtainium Era" and is a step towards the "Eludium Era" [6, 7].

*   **Storage Bottleneck:** Acquiring the **Storage Bunkers** upgrade, which Exogeology unlocks, is recommended once you reach **500 Unobtainium** capacity [8]. This helps address storage limits, which are a major bottleneck in the game [9, 10].
*   **Late-Game Progression:** After achieving **Concrete Huts** (unlocked by Mechanization) [11], players should aim for **Unobtainium Huts**, which are unlocked by Exogeology, before attempting to reset the game, as this marks a major population and storage milestone [12].
*   **Eludium Goal:** The ultimate goal after Exogeology is to research Exometallurgy to craft Eludium. This typically requires significant **Unobtainium storage** (e.g., 1000 Unobtainium capacity via multiple **Moon Bases** or a **Cryostation**) to reach the capacity needed for Eludium Huts [7].

If you are following the recommended progression path, you should continue resetting once you can reach the **Unobtainium Huts** until you have acquired the **Renaissance** Metaphysics upgrade (750 Paragon), which makes reaching Unobtainium Huts easier in subsequent runs [7].
