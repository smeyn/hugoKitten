[Exogeology]( {{< relref "exogeology.md" >}}) is a key mid-to-late-game science technology that is essential for unlocking advanced storage capacity, new building materials, and the next tier of housing upgrades.

### 1. Prerequisites and Cost

*   **Unlocking:** Exogeology is unlocked after successfully researching [Orbital Engineering]( {{< relref "orbital_engineering.md" >}}) [1]
*   **Cost:** To research Exogeology, you must pay **275K Science** and **250 Blueprints** [1].

### 2. Unlocks and Follow-up Science

Researching Exogeology unlocks several crucial elements and leads directly to the next phase of high-tier crafting:

*   **Next Science Tier:** It unlocks **Exometallurgy** (formerly Advanced Exogeology), which is the science required to enable the crafting of [Eludium]( {{< relref "craft/Eludium.md" >}}) [2].
*   **Housing Upgrade:** It unlocks the [Unobtainium Huts]( {{< relref "unobtainium_huts.md" >}}) upgrade [1]. This upgrade requires **200K Science**, **350 Unobtainium**, and **15K Titanium**, and reduces the Hut price ratio by 25% [3].
*   **Storage and Production Upgrades:** It unlocks several specialized Workshop upgrades [1]:
    *   [Unobtainium Reflectors:]( {{< relref "unobtainium_reflectors.md" >}}) These improve telescope reflectors, increasing the maximum science bonus gained from Observatories by an additional 2% per Observatory [4].
    *   [Unobtainium Drill:]( {{< relref "unobtainium_drill.md" >}}) This improves the effectiveness of [Geologists]( {{< relref "job/Geologist.md" >}}) [4].
    *   [Hydro Plant Turbines:]( {{< relref "hydro_plant_turbines.md" >}}) This upgrade makes Hydro Plants 15% more effective (increasing energy output from 5 Wt to 5.75 Wt) [4].
    *   [Storage Bunkers:]( {{< relref "storage_bunkers.md" >}}) This is a vital storage upgrade that increases the maximum storage limit for wood, minerals, coal, iron, gold, and titanium from Warehouses, Barns, Harbors, and Mints by **20%** [5]. The storage bunkers upgrade requires **25K Science**, **500 Unobtainium**, and **1250 Concrete** [5].

### 3. Strategic Importance (The Unobtainium Era)

Exogeology marks the beginning of the "Unobtainium Era" and is a step towards the "Eludium Era" [6, 7].

*   **Storage Bottleneck:** Acquiring the [Storage Bunkers]( {{< relref "storage_bunkers.md" >}}) upgrade, which Exogeology unlocks, is recommended once you reach **500 Unobtainium** capacity [8]. This helps address storage limits, which are a major bottleneck in the game [9, 10].
*   **Late-Game Progression:** After achieving [Concrete Huts]( {{< relref "concrete_huts.md" >}}) (unlocked by Mechanization) [11], players should aim for [Unobtainium Huts]( {{< relref "unobtainium_huts.md" >}}), which are unlocked by Exogeology, before attempting to reset the game, as this marks a major population and storage milestone [12].
*   **Eludium Goal:** The ultimate goal after Exogeology is to research Exometallurgy to craft Eludium. This typically requires significant **Unobtainium storage** (e.g., 1000 Unobtainium capacity via multiple **Moon Bases** or a **Cryostation**) to reach the capacity needed for Eludium Huts [7].

If you are following the recommended progression path, you should continue resetting once you can reach the [Unobtainium Huts]( {{< relref "unobtainium_huts.md" >}}) until you have acquired the **Renaissance** Metaphysics upgrade (750 Paragon), which makes reaching Unobtainium Huts easier in subsequent runs [7].
