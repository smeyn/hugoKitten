The research [Electricity]( {{< relref "techs/Electricity.md" >}}) is a critical mid-game technology in *Kittens Game*, enabling the expansion of your industrial and energy infrastructure.

### Unlocking and Cost

*   **Prerequisite:** Electricity is unlocked after researching [Physics]( {{< relref "techs/Physics.md" >}}). Physics itself requires 50,000 Science and 35 Compendiums.
*   **Cost:** Researching Electricity requires **75,000 Science** and **85 Compendiums**.

### Strategic Role and Progression

Electricity is a vital step in the technological chain, leading to higher levels of industrial and space technology:

*   **Building Unlocked:** Researching Electricity unlocks the [Magneto]( {{< relref "buildings/Magneto.md" >}}) building. Magnetos are crucial industrial structures that provide a **+2% Global Production** bonus and **+5 Energy**.
*   **Next Technology:** Electricity unlocks the subsequent research branch, [Industrialization]( {{< relref "techs/Industrialization.md" >}}).
*   **Late-Game Path:** Electricity is part of the progression required to reach advanced technologies such as [Mechanization]( {{< relref "techs/Mechanization.md" >}}) (which enables Concrete). The technology line progresses through Physics $\to$ [Electricity]( {{< relref "techs/Electricity.md" >}}) $\to$ Industrialization $\to$ Mechanization.
*   **Electronics Unlock:** The Industrialization branch, unlocked by Electricity, eventually leads to the [Electronics]( {{< relref "techs/Electronics.md" >}}) science. Electronics unlocks critical utility upgrades, including [SETI]( {{< relref "upgrade/SETI.md" >}}) (which automates astronomical events for Starchart acquisition) and enables the upgrade of Libraries to [Data Centers]( {{< relref "buildings/Data_Center.md" >}}).

In the mid-game, Electricity is listed alongside Chemistry, Acoustics, and Geology as a research option, noted for advancing the player "one step closer to something useful".
