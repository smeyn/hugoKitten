[Biology]( {{< relref "techs/Biology.md" >}}) is a mid-to-late-game technology research that unlocks the [Bio Lab]( {{< relref "buildings/Bio_Lab.md" >}}) building, primarily serving to significantly boost scientific capacity and facilitate the advanced production of oil.

### Technology Details

*   **Prerequisite:** Biology is unlocked after researching [Geology]( {{< relref "techs/Geology.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:** Researching Biology requires **85,000 Science** and **100 Compendium**.
*   **Unlocks:** Biology immediately unlocks the [Bio Lab]( {{< relref "buildings/Bio_Lab.md" >}}) building and the subsequent research, [Biochemistry]( {{< relref "techs/Biochemistry.md" >}}).

### The Bio Lab Building

The building unlocked by this technology provides major science and resource bonuses, but requires moderately advanced materials to construct:

| Category | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | 100 Slab, 25 Alloy, and 1500 Science. |
| **Science Effect** | Provides a **+35% Science** bonus and increases **Max Science by +1500** per Bio Lab. |
| **Refinement** | Increases **Catnip refinement by +10%**. |
  
### Strategic Significance

Biology and the Bio Lab are important for players pushing toward the endgame, particularly for managing science bottlenecks and expanding energy production:

1.  **Science Capacity:** Bio Labs are used to reach very high science capacity limits (e.g., 125K maximum Science) for late-game research, reducing the need to rely on continuously constructing expensive Observatories or Temples.
2.  **Industrial Transition:** Biology is vital for entering the advanced energy era. It leads to [Biochemistry]( {{< relref "techs/Biochemistry.md" >}}), which unlocks the [Biofuel Processing]( {{< relref "upgrade/Biofuel_Processing.md" >}}) upgrade. This upgrade allows [Bio Labs]( {{< relref "buildings/Bio_Lab.md" >}}) to convert catnip into oil at a rate of 0.10 oil per second, consuming 5 catnip per second and 1 Watt of energy. This automation is useful for overcoming **oil production bottlenecks**.
3.  **Cross-Building Synergy:** Bio Labs are connected to [Data Centers]( {{< relref "buildings/Data_Center.md" >}}) (upgraded Libraries) via the [Uplink]( {{< relref "upgrade/Uplink.md" >}}) and [Starlink]( {{< relref "upgrade/Starlink.md" >}}) workshop upgrades, which provide reciprocal increases to maximum science, culture, and compendium caps between the two building types.
4.  **Early Game Recommendation:** Due to the relatively high science, Compendium, Slab, and Alloy costs of this research and its resulting building, players are generally advised to **skip Biology** on their first couple of runs. It becomes worthwhile once players can easily craft [Alloy]( {{< relref "craft/Alloy.md" >}}).

For complex industrial advancement, researching Biology helps convert your massive catnip surplus into critical industrial fuel (oil), which is essential for powering advanced space and factory structures.
