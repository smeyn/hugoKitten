+++
[Kerosene]( {{< relref "resource/kerosene.md" >}}) is a high-tier craftable resource in *Kittens Game* that serves as the essential **rocket fuel** for late-game space exploration. It is produced by refining **oil** and is required to fund most space missions and construct advanced orbital infrastructure.

### **Acquisition and Cost**
*   **Unlocking:** You must research the [Oil Processing]( {{< relref "techs/Oil_Processing.md" >}}) technology (215k Science, 150 Blueprints), which is available only after completing [Rocketry]( {{< relref "techs/Rocketry.md" >}}).
*   **Crafting Cost:** Each unit of kerosene costs **7,500 oil**.
*   **Refinement Bonuses:**
    *   [Factory Processing:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Factory_Processing.md" >}}) This workshop upgrade (available via Oil Processing) increases the effectiveness of kerosene refinement by **5% per Factory**.
    *   **Chemist Trait:** Assigning a kitten with the **Chemist trait** as your Leader provides a **+0.075 craft ratio bonus** to kerosene production.

### **Primary Uses in Space**
Kerosene is mandatory for nearly all activities beyond the initial orbital launch:
*   **Space Missions:** It is required for missions to [Dune]( {{< relref "planet/Dune.md" >}}) (75 kerosene), [Piscine]( {{< relref "planet/Piscine.md" >}}) (250), [Helios]( {{< relref "planet/Helios.md" >}}) (1,250), [T-minus]( {{< relref "planet/T_Minus.md" >}}) (750), [Kairo]( {{< relref "planet/Kairo.md" >}}) (7,500), and beyond.
*   **Orbital Structures:** Large quantities are needed for high-tier buildings, most notably **Space Beacons** (7,500), **Heatsinks** (5,000), **Terraforming Stations** (5,000), and [Sunlifters]( {{< relref "space/sunlifter.md" >}}) (2,500).
*   **Infrastructure Upgrades:** It is a required material for upgrading Warehouses into **Spaceports** (1,000 kerosene).

### **Strategic Management and Automation**
Because oil production is often slow but kerosene requirements are massive, managing the oil-to-kerosene pipeline is a common late-game bottleneck.
*   **Engineer Automation:** Once you have [Engineers]( {{< relref "job/Engineer.md" >}}), you can assign them to **automatically craft kerosene**. This is highly recommended to prevent oil from hitting its storage cap and halting production while you are away from the game.
*   **Storage Requirements:** To reach the 7,500 oil threshold for a single craft, you will likely need to build numerous [Oil Wells]( {{< relref "buildings/Oil_Well.md" >}}) or [Tankers]( {{< relref "craft/Tanker.md" >}}).

### **Preservation and Resets**
As a crafted resource, kerosene is **normally lost when you reset** the game. However, it can be preserved across runs if you possess:
1.  [Chronospheres:]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}) Each active sphere preserves a portion of your resources.
2.  [Flux Condensator:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Flux_Condensator.md" >}}) This specific workshop upgrade (unlocked via Chronophysics) is required for Chronospheres to carry over **crafted resources** like kerosene. 

The amount of kerosene saved is determined by the number of Chronospheres and the square root of your total kerosene at the time of reset. This preservation is essential for **"Positive Resets,"** allowing you to bypass the early-game oil grind and return to space immediately in a new run.
