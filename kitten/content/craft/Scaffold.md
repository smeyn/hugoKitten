[Scaffolds]( {{< relref "craft/Scaffold.md" >}}) are a vital mid-game craftable resource used primarily for industrial construction, storage expansion, and the development of the colony's naval fleet. They are produced in the [Workshop]( {{< relref "buildings/Workshop.md" >}}) at a base cost of **50 Beams** per craft.

### **Core Utility: Naval and Trade Expansion**
The most significant strategic milestone involving scaffolds is the transition into the **Titanium Era**.
*   [Trade Ships:]( {{< relref "craft/Trade_Ship.md" >}}) Crafting a set of trade ships requires **100 scaffolds** each.
*   **Discovery:** Possessing at least one trade ship is the prerequisite for exploring and discovering the [Zebras]( {{< relref "trade/zebras.md" >}}), the primary source of titanium through trade.
*   [Harbours:]( {{< relref "buildings/Harbour.md" >}}) Scaffolds are required to build **Harbours (5 scaffolds each)**, which provide a massive boost to the storage capacity of multiple resources.

### **Industrial and Scientific Infrastructure**
Scaffolds serve as a foundational material for several critical bonfire structures and religious buildings:
*   **Observatories:** Each observatory requires **50 scaffolds**. These are essential for increasing the science cap and automating the collection of **Starcharts**.
*   **Production Buildings:** They are a required component for **Oil Wells (25 scaffolds)** and **Quarries (50 scaffolds)**, both of which are necessary for stabilizing energy and mineral supplies.
*   **Unicorn Religion:** Building [Ziggurats]( {{< relref "buildings/Ziggurat.md" >}}) requires **50 scaffolds** each. This is the gateway structure for sacrificing unicorns to obtain **Unicorn Tears**.

### **Trade and High-Tier Upgrades**
*   **Trading with Spiders:** Scaffolds are the primary trade currency for the [Spiders]( {{< relref "trade/spiders.md" >}}). They will buy **50 scaffolds** in exchange for a large amount of **Coal and Oil**.
*   **Advanced Workshop Upgrades:** Later in the game, scaffolds are required for expensive upgrades such as **Titanium Warehouses (500)** and **Logistics (1,000)**.

### **Persistence and Resets**
As a crafted resource, scaffolds are **normally lost upon resetting** the game. To preserve a portion of your stockpile across runs, you must possess at least one [Chronosphere]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}) and the [Flux Condensator]( {{< relref "upgrade/Flux_Condensator.md" >}}) workshop upgrade. The amount carried over is calculated based on the number of chronospheres and the square root of the total quantity held at the time of reset.
