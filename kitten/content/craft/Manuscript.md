[Manuscripts]( {{< relref "resource/manuscript.md" >}}) are a vital mid-game craftable resource that serves as a sum of modern knowledge for your kittens, acting as a primary gate for advanced scientific research and cultural expansion.

### **Crafting and Acquisition**
*   **Unlocked By:** You gain the ability to craft manuscripts after researching the [Writing]( {{< relref "techs/Writing.md" >}}) technology.
*   **Standard Cost:** Each manuscript costs **25 Parchment and 400 Culture**.
*   **Policy Efficiency:** By enacting the [Tradition]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}) policy, the cost is reduced to **20 Parchment and 300 Culture**, and the manuscript's effect on maximum culture is doubled.
*   [Trading:]( {{< relref "guides/trading.md" >}}) Manuscripts can be obtained through **trade with the Sharks** (15% chance) once you have an Embassy level of at least 10.

### **Automation and Scaling**
The "Theology hurdle"—the period where you must grind manuscripts manually—is a notorious progression bottleneck. To overcome this, players typically rely on the [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}) building for automated production:
*   [Printing Press:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Printing_Press.md" >}}) This workshop upgrade allows Steamworks to automatically print **0.0025 manuscripts per second**.
*   [Offset Press:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Offset_Press.md" >}}) Increases Steamworks production to **0.01 per second**.
*   [Photolithography:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Photolithography.md" >}}) Further boosts production to **0.04 per second**.

### **Primary Uses**
Manuscripts are mandatory for transitioning into the religious and celestial eras of the game:
*   **Technology Requirements:** They are required to research **Theology (35)**, **Astronomy (65)**, and **Navigation (100)**.
*   **Building Construction:** Each [Temple]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}) requires **10 manuscripts** to build.
*   **Resource Conversion:** They are the base material for crafting [Compendiums]( {{< relref "resource/Compendium.md" >}}), requiring **50 manuscripts** each.
*   **Culture Boost:** Owning manuscripts provides a **minor bonus to your maximum culture cap**, though this effect suffers from diminishing returns.

### **Strategic Advice**
*   **Grinding Tactic:** Before automation is available, the most efficient way to acquire manuscripts is to assign all kittens to the [Hunter]( {{< relref "job/Hunter.md" >}}) job to mass-produce parchment, then wait for culture to max out before using the "craft all" manuscript button.
*   **Metaphysics Synergy:** The **Codex Vox** upgrade adds a **+25% bonus to your craft ratio** for manuscripts and provides a **1.05x multiplier** to all manuscript crafting.
*   **Religious Pivot:** If you enact the **Lizard Relations: Priests** policy, manuscripts will grant **maximum faith** instead of a portion of the maximum culture they usually provide.
