[Trade Ships]( {{< relref "craft/Trade_Ship.md" >}}) are a craftable resource in *Kittens Game* essential for enabling trade with other civilisations, particularly for acquiring late-game bottleneck resources like titanium.

### Unlocking and Crafting

*   **Prerequisite:** Trade Ships are unlocked after researching [Navigation]( {{< relref "techs/Navigation.md" >}}) science, which itself requires [Astronomy]( {{< relref "techs/Astronomy.md" >}}) (28K Science, 65 Manuscripts) and **100 Manuscripts** to research.
*   **Crafting Cost:** Crafting a single Trade Ship requires:
    *   **100 Scaffold**
    *   **150 Plate**
    *   **25 Starchart**
*   **Cost Reduction:** The starchart requirement to craft Trade Ships can be reduced by the [Satellite Navigation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Satellite_Navigation.md" >}}) upgrade, offering a 1.25\% discount per active Satellite, up to a maximum discount of 75\%. At 45 Satellites, the cost reaches 10.9375 Starcharts, where diminishing returns begin.

### Functionality and Strategic Importance

Trade Ships serve several critical roles in resource acquisition and infrastructure:

1.  **Enabling Exploration and Trade:** Owning at least **one Trade Ship** is the prerequisite for discovering and trading with the [Zebras]( {{< relref "trade/zebras.md" >}}).
2.  **Acquisition of Titanium:** Trade Ships are critical for solving the titanium bottleneck. Zebras sell Titanium in amounts determined by the number of Trade Ships you possess, via the formula (0.03 * Trade Ships) + 1.5. Importantly, this amount of titanium acquired is **not** affected by normal trading bonuses like those from Tradeposts.
3.  **Storage Enhancement:** Trade Ships enhance the storage capacity of [Harbours]( {{< relref "buildings/Harbour.md" >}}) through the [Expanded Cargo]( {{< relref "upgrade/Expanded_Cargo.md" >}}) Workshop upgrade. Each Trade Ship provides a +1\% bonus to Harbour capacity, subject to diminishing returns past 168.75\% and a maximum limit of 225\%. This limit can be further increased by +5\% per active [Reactor]( {{< relref "buildings/Reactor.md" >}}) if the [Reactor Vessel]( {{< relref "upgrade/Reactor_Vessel.md" >}}) upgrade is researched.
4.  **Mid-Game Progression:** Accumulating Trade Ships accelerates the titanium and iron acquisition necessary for constructing advanced buildings, such as **Observatories**. Due to the high iron requirement of Observatories, gaining titanium from Zebras allows you to stock up on resources needed to progress to the next technological tier.

### Strategic Notes

*   Trade Ships are listed as a **craftable resource** that increases oil limit when crafted into a [Tanker]( {{< relref "craft/Tanker.md" >}}).
*   Starcharts are a significant bottleneck for this stage of the game, making the acquisition of Observatories—which increase the chance of astronomical events and subsequent starchart production—a high priority to sustain Trade Ship construction.
*   In the endgame, Trade Ships are sometimes ignored in favor of mints for Blueprint generation, but later become the **fastest possible reset method** when trading is used to acquire the blueprints needed for Chronospheres.
