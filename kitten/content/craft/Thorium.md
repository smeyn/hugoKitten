[Thorium]( {{< relref "resource/thorium.md" >}}) is a high-tier, highly radioactive craftable resource in *Kittens Game* that serves as a critical fuel for late-game energy production and deep-space exploration. It is primarily used to power advanced reactors and fund missions to the furthest reaches of the star system.

### **Acquisition and Production**
*   **Research Requirements:** To unlock Thorium, you must research the **Thorium science node**, which costs **375,000 Science and 375 Blueprints**. This technology becomes available after researching [Orbital Engineering]( {{< relref "techs/Orbital_Engineering.md" >}}).
*   **Workshop Crafting:** Once researched, Thorium can be crafted in the Workshop at a base cost of **250 Uranium** per unit.
*   [Trading:]( {{< relref "guides/trading.md" >}}) You can also acquire Thorium by **trading with Dragons**. They have a **50% chance** to sell Thorium in exchange for titanium, provided you have reached **Embassy level 5**.
*   **Crafting Bonuses:** Assigning a kitten with the **Chemist trait** as your Leader provides a **+0.075 bonus to the craft ratio** for Thorium.

### **Energy and Infrastructure Upgrades**
Thorium is central to scaling your energy grid and scientific capacity through several key Workshop upgrades:
*   [Thorium Reactors:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Thorium_Reactors.md" >}}) This upgrade increases the energy output of your **Reactors by 25%**, but introduces a consumption rate of **0.05 Thorium per tick** (0.25 per second) per active reactor.
*   [Enriched Thorium:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Enriched_Thorium.md" >}}) This vital efficiency upgrade reduces the Thorium consumption of your reactors by **0.0625 per tick**, helping to stabilise your stockpiles.
*   [Quantum Dot Cells:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Quantum_Dot_Cells.md" >}}) Costs **175k Science, 200 Eludium, and 1000 Thorium**. It improves Solar Farm energy production by **15% in winter** and **30% in spring and autumn**.
*   [Thorium Drive:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Thorium_Drive.md" >}}) A high-tier engine that divides space travel time by **50** (or 75 if combined with an Antimatter Drive).

### **Space Missions and Structures**
As you progress into the late-game "Umbra" and "Centaurus" eras, Thorium becomes a mandatory requirement for exploration:
*   **Missions:** Significant quantities are required for missions to **Umbra (15,000)**, **Charon (35,000)**, **Centaurus (50,000)**, and the **Furthest Ring (75,000)**.
*   **Heatsinks:** Essential for increasing antimatter storage, each Heatsink costs **12,500 Thorium**.
*   **Tectonics:** These space structures, which generate **25 Watts** of energy, cost **75,000 Thorium** each.

### **Strategic Utility**
*   **The Antimatter Seed:** In long "seed runs" aimed at reaching a **5,000 antimatter capacity**, Thorium is often a major bottleneck. Reaching the milestone of 34 Heatsinks requires over **526,000 Thorium**.
*   **Energy Management:** Strategic guides recommend **turning off Thorium Reactors** during most of the run to conserve fuel, only activating them when **time skipping** or when a massive energy surplus is required for antimatter generation.
*   **Preservation:** As a crafted resource, Thorium is **normally lost upon resetting**. To carry it over into a new run, you must possess [Chronospheres]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}) and the [Flux Condensator]( {{< relref "upgrade/Flux_Condensator.md" >}}) Workshop upgrade. The amount preserved is determined by the square root of your total Thorium at the time of reset.
