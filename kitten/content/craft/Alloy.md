[Alloy]( {{< relref "craft/Alloy.md" >}}) is a crucial craftable resource in *Kittens Game*, marking a mid-to-late game phase of infrastructure development.

### Resource Details

Alloy is a composite material refined from other metals and is categorised as a **craftable resource**.

| Detail | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prerequisite Technology** | [Chemistry]( {{< relref "techs/Chemistry.md" >}}), which itself requires Physics. |
| **Crafting Cost** | **75 Steel** and **10 Titanium**. |
| **Unlocks** | The crafting of Alloy is unlocked by the [Chemistry]( {{< relref "techs/Chemistry.md" >}}) technology. |

### Uses and Strategic Importance

Alloy is necessary for constructing advanced buildings, structures, and various Workshop upgrades:

1.  **Buildings:**
    *   [Bio Lab:]( {{< relref "buildings/Bio_Lab.md" >}}) Requires 25 Alloy and 100 Slab to build, significantly boosting Science production and storage.
    *   [Magneto:]( {{< relref "buildings/Magneto.md" >}}) Requires 10 Alloy, 5 Gear, and 1 Blueprint to construct, providing a crucial **+2% Global Production** boost and generating 5 Energy.
2.  **Workshop Upgrades:** Alloy is the prerequisite material for several high-tier upgrades:
    *   [Alloy Saw:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Alloy_Saw.md" >}}) Requires Alloy and improves Lumber Mill efficiency by $+15\%$.
    *   [Alloy Axe:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Alloy_Axe.md" >}}) Requires Alloy and makes Woodcutters $50\%$ more effective.
    *   **Alloy Barns/Warehouses:** Required for various storage upgrades.
    *   **Alloy Armour/Nanosuits:** Required for advanced Hunting bonuses.

### Progression in the "Alloy Era"

The point where Alloy becomes readily available signals a major checkpoint in the game's progression.

*   **Technology Path:** Getting to the Alloy era requires a specific scientific path: Navigation $\to$ Physics $\to$ [Chemistry]( {{< relref "techs/Chemistry.md" >}}).
*   **Resource Bottlenecks:** Alloy requires substantial amounts of [Titanium]( {{< relref "resource/titanium.md" >}}), which must be acquired primarily through trading slabs with [Zebras]( {{< relref "trade/zebras.md" >}}). This titanium requirement mandates ongoing construction of Trade Ships and Observatories (to acquire Starcharts).
*   **Strategic Focus:** Once Alloy is unlocked, strategic focus shifts to purchasing **Alloy buildings** and the associated upgrades to boost storage and production. The next major goal after the Alloy era is typically achieving [Concrete Huts]( {{< relref "upgrade/Concrete_Huts.md" >}}).
*   **Trait Bonus:** Kittens with the **Metallurgist** trait, when assigned as a leader, provide a specific bonus to metal crafting efficiency, increasing the craft ratio for resources including Alloy by $+0.1$.

Finally, Alloy is also a component, alongside Unobtainium, in crafting the late-game resource [Eludium]( {{< relref "resource/eludium.md" >}}).
