[Metal Plates]( {{< relref "craft/Metal_Plate.md" >}}) (often simply referred to as [Plates]( {{< relref "resource/plate.md" >}})) are a foundational mid-game craftable resource refined from iron, primarily used for expanding storage and established industrial infrastructure.

### **Crafting and Acquisition**
*   **Workshop Crafting:** A single Metal Plate costs **125 Iron**. Because the default iron storage limit is only 50, you must first expand your capacity using [Barns]( {{< relref "buildings/Barn.md" >}}) or other storage buildings before you can craft them.
*   **Trading with Zebras:** Once you have discovered the Zebras, they provide a reliable alternative source for plates. There is a **65% base chance** to receive 2 plates per successful trade. This probability can be increased to **100%** by reaching **Embassy level 54**.
*   **Automation:** Researching the [Pneumatic Press]( {{< relref "upgrade/Pneumatic_Press.md" >}}) workshop upgrade allows [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}) to automatically convert a portion of your iron into plates twice per year whenever your iron is near its storage limit.
*   **Kitten Traits:** Assigning a kitten with the **Metallurgist trait** as your Leader provides a **+0.1 bonus to the craft ratio** for plates.

### **Primary Uses**
Metal plates are mandatory for progressing into the "Titanium Era" and establishing advanced energy systems:
*   [Trade Ships:]( {{< relref "craft/Trade_Ship.md" >}}) Building your first fleet requires **150 plates** (along with scaffolds and starcharts). These ships are essential for discovering Zebras and beginning titanium acquisition.
*   **Storage Buildings:** They are a core component for [Harbours]( {{< relref "buildings/Harbour.md" >}}) (75 plates) and [Mints]( {{< relref "buildings/Mint.md" >}}) (200 plates).
*   **Industrial Structures:** High-tier buildings require massive quantities, including **Factories** (2,500 plates) and [Reactors]( {{< relref "buildings/Reactor.md" >}}) (5,000 plates).
*   **Religious Infrastructure:** Each [Temple]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}) requires 15 plates.
*   **Workshop Upgrades:** Several critical upgrades depend on plates, such as [Reinforced Warehouses]( {{< relref "upgrade/Reinforced_Warehouses.md" >}}) (50 plates) and [Alloy Barns]( {{< relref "upgrade/Alloy_Barns.md" >}}) (750 plates).

### **Strategic Utility**
In the early-to-mid game, plates are often a bottleneck for expanding storage. Strategic guides suggest that if your [Coal]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}) production is too slow to craft [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}), you should instead focus your iron on crafting plates to build more [Harbours]( {{< relref "buildings/Harbour.md" >}}). This increases your global storage caps, allowing you to eventually afford the more expensive upgrades and buildings.

### **Persistence and Resets**
As a crafted resource, Metal Plates are **normally lost upon resetting** the game. To preserve a portion of your stockpile for the next run, you must possess at least one [Chronosphere]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}) and the [Flux Condensator]( {{< relref "upgrade/Flux_Condensator.md" >}}) workshop upgrade. The amount carried over is determined by the number of active Chronospheres and the **square root** of your total plate count at the time of reset.
