[Bloodstone]( {{< relref "craft/Bloodstone.md" >}}) is classified as an **uncommon resource** in *Kittens Game* that plays a role in late-game crafting and unlocks specific buildings associated with the Zebras,. It is poetically described as **a strange jewelry claimed to be made of time and a blood of elder gods**.

### Acquisition Methods

Bloodstone can be acquired through hunting and crafted using advanced resources:

1.  **Hunting:** Bloodstone has a chance to be found when engaging in hunting, provided you have at least **10 Zebras**,. In the **Iron Will** challenge mode, the chance to yield a bloodstone during a hunt is **0.05%** if you already have it. However, this chance increases significantly to **5% if you do not already have bloodstone**.

2.  **Crafting:** Bloodstone is a craftable item unlocked by the [Zebra Forge]( {{< relref "buildings/Zebra_Forge.md" >}}). The crafting cost is high, requiring temporal and elder resources: **5,000 Time Crystal** and **10,000 Relic**.

### Uses and Buildings

Bloodstone is a prerequisite resource for several Zebra structures and other craftable materials:

*   [Zebra Outpost:]( {{< relref "buildings/Zebra_Outpost.md" >}}) Requires 1 Bloodstone.
*   [Zebra Workshop:]( {{< relref "buildings/Zebra_Workshop.md" >}}) Requires 5 Bloodstone.
*   [Zebra Forge:]( {{< relref "buildings/Zebra_Forge.md" >}}) Requires 50 Bloodstone. The Zebra Forge itself unlocks the ability to craft Bloodstone, as well as [T-Mythril]( {{< relref "craft/T-Mythril.md" >}}).
*   [T-Mythril:]( {{< relref "craft/T-Mythril.md" >}}) Bloodstone is a component in crafting T-Mythril,.

### Persistence

As a craftable resource, Bloodstone is retained across game resets, but only conditionally. It is carried over if the player has Chronospheres built and the [Flux Condensator]( {{< relref "upgrade/Flux_Condensator.md" >}}) workshop upgrade researched. The amount carried over is subject to diminishing returns.
