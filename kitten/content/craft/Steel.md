[Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) is a mid-game technology and a critical craftable resource in *Kittens Game*, marking a major step toward industrialization and advanced building construction.

Here is a comprehensive overview of Steel based on the sources:

### Steel Technology

The technology named [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) has the following characteristics:

*   **Prerequisite:** It is unlocked after researching [Writing]( {{< relref "techs/Writing.md" >}}).
*   **Cost:** Researching Steel requires **12,000 Science**.
*   **Strategic Timing:** Steel is one of the three "specialist Techs" available after Writing (alongside Philosophy and Machinery). Strategic advice suggests researching [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) first among these three options to acquire useful upgrades that strengthen your economy.

### Steel Resource (Crafting and Composition)

Steel is a **Craftable Resource**.

*   **Composition:** Steel is made by combining **100 Iron** and **100 Coal**.
*   **Acquisition:** The research of the Steel technology **enables the resource Steel**.
*   [Trading:]( {{< relref "guides/trading.md" >}}) Steel can also be acquired through trade, notably from [Griffins]( {{< relref "trade/Griffins.md" >}}), who sell 25 Steel per trade once you reach Embassy Level 5. Griffins buy Wood.

### Key Unlocks and Upgrades

Researching Steel unlocks critical Workshop Upgrades, many of which focus on resource efficiency and early Coal production:

| Upgrade Name | Cost Components (Examples) | Primary Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Coal Furnace]( {{< relref "upgrade/Coal_Furnace.md" >}}) | Science, Minerals, Iron, Beam | Allows [Smelters]( {{< relref "buildings/Smelter.md" >}}) to produce **0.005 Coal per tick** while burning wood. |
| [Deep Mining]( {{< relref "upgrade/Deep_Mining.md" >}}) | Science, Iron, Beam | Allows [Mines]( {{< relref "buildings/Mine.md" >}}) to produce **0.003 Coal per tick**. |
| [Steel Axe]( {{< relref "upgrade/Steel_Axe.md" >}}) | Science, Steel | Makes **Woodcutters 50% more effective**. |
| [Reinforced Warehouses]( {{< relref "upgrade/Reinforced_Warehouses.md" >}}) | Science, Plate, Steel, Scaffold | Increases resource storage in Warehouses, Barns, Harbours, and Mints by **25%**. |
| [Steel Armour]( {{< relref "upgrade/Steel_Armour.md" >}}) | Science, Steel | Provides a **+0.5 Hunting bonus**. |
| [Steel Saw]( {{< relref "upgrade/Steel_Saw.md" >}}) | Science, Steel | Improves **Lumber Mill efficiency by 20%**. |
| [High Pressure Engine]( {{< relref "upgrade/High_Pressure_Engine.md" >}}) | Science, Gear, Blueprint | Reduces **Steamworks coal consumption by 20%**. |

### Usage in Buildings and Crafting

Steel is crucial for moving beyond basic construction into industrial and specialized buildings:

*   **Advanced Materials:** Steel is required for crafting [Gears]( {{< relref "craft/Gear.md" >}}).
*   **Industrial Buildings:**
    *   The [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}) building requires 65 Steel (along with 20 Gear and 1 Blueprint).
    *   The [Quarry]( {{< relref "buildings/Quarry.md" >}}) building requires 125 Steel.
    *   The [Calciner]( {{< relref "buildings/Calciner.md" >}}) building requires 100 Steel.
*   **Housing:** It is required for the mid-game [Mansion]( {{< relref "buildings/Mansion.md" >}}) building (75 Steel).
*   **Crafting:** Steel is a component of [Concrete]( {{< relref "craft/Concrete.md" >}}), which is crafted from 25 Steel and 2500 Slab.

### Strategic Notes

*   **Early Coal:** Steel is essential because it unlocks the upgrades ([Coal Furnace]( {{< relref "upgrade/Coal_Furnace.md" >}}) and [Deep Mining]( {{< relref "upgrade/Deep_Mining.md" >}})) necessary to begin accumulating [Coal]( {{< relref "resource/coal.md" >}}). Coal is required to craft Steel itself, and to power industrial structures like the Steamworks.
*   **Iron Priority:** Once Steel is researched and the coal-producing upgrades are acquired, players are often advised to let Coal production max out. This is because the **Iron** used to produce Coal is highly valuable and better prioritized for building [Lumber Mills]( {{< relref "buildings/Lumber_Mill.md" >}}) and **Observatories**.
*   **Trade Importance:** Trading with Zebras yields Iron, which can then be converted into Steel. This trade route helps maintain a supply of Steel, especially once it becomes a bottleneck for future buildings.
