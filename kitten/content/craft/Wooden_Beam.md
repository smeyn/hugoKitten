A [Wooden Beam]( {{< relref "craft/Wooden_Beam.md" >}}) (often simply called a **Beam**) is a foundational mid-game craftable resource in *Kittens Game* refined from wood. It serves as a primary support structure required for advanced construction and the development of the colony's industrial and religious infrastructure.

### **Acquisition and Production**
*   **Workshop Crafting:** A single wooden beam costs **175 Wood**. Because this cost is relatively low compared to later-game items, players often mass-craft beams once their wood storage is expanded.
*   **Trading with Lizards:** Once you reach **Embassy level 5** with the Lizards, they have a **15% chance** of selling you 10 beams in exchange for 1,000 minerals.
*   **Automation:** Researching [Workshop Automation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Workshop_Automation.md" >}}) allows [Steamworks]( {{< relref "buildings/Steamworks.md" >}}) to automatically convert a portion of your wood into beams once per year whenever your wood reaches 98% of its storage cap. This frequency increases to twice per year with the [Advanced Automation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Advanced_Automation.md" >}}) upgrade.

### **Primary Uses in Construction**
Beams are a mandatory material for several critical buildings and higher-tier resources:
*   **Storage Expansion:** They are required to build [Warehouses]( {{< relref "buildings/Warehouse.md" >}}) (1.5 beams each), which are essential for increasing the global caps for multiple resources.
*   **Mega Structures:** Beams are a component for crafting [Megaliths]( {{< relref "craft/Megalith.md" >}}) (25 beams each), which are used to build [Ziggurats]( {{< relref "buildings/Ziggurat.md" >}}) and other religious structures.
*   **Naval Infrastructure:** They are the primary input for crafting [Scaffolds]( {{< relref "craft/Scaffold.md" >}}) (50 beams each), which are needed for building [Trade Ships]( {{< relref "craft/Trade_Ship.md" >}}) and [Harbours]( {{< relref "buildings/Harbour.md" >}}).

### **Workshop Upgrades**
Several essential Workshop upgrades require a stockpile of beams to improve the colony's efficiency:
*   **Reinforced Barns (25 Beams):** Increases the storage space for wood, minerals, and iron by 80%.
*   **Coal Furnace (2,000 Beams):** Allows Smelters to produce coal while burning wood.
*   **Deep Mining (1,200 Beams):** Allows Mines to produce a small amount of coal.

### **Strategic Utility and Resets**
In the early-to-mid game, beams are often the first major "crafting hurdle" players face as they transition from raw wood collection to organised manufacturing. Strategic guides suggest that once the [Construction]( {{< relref "techs/Construction.md" >}}) science is researched, players should prioritise building enough warehouses to raise their storage caps for iron and science.

As a crafted resource, wooden beams are **normally lost upon resetting** the game. To carry them over into a new run, a player must possess at least one [Chronosphere]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}) and the [Flux Condensator]( {{< relref "upgrade/Flux_Condensator.md" >}}) Workshop upgrade. The amount preserved follows a square root formula based on the total quantity held at the time of reset.
