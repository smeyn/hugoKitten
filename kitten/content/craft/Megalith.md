[Megaliths]( {{< relref "craft/Megalith.md" >}}) are a mid-to-late game craftable resource used primarily for the construction of megastructures and the advancement of the unicorn religion.

### **Acquisition and Crafting**
*   **Workshop Crafting:** Once the prerequisite technologies are met, a single megalith can be crafted using **50 Slabs, 25 Beams, and 5 Plates**. 
*   **Trading with Nagas:** Megaliths can also be obtained through **trade with the Nagas**. This requires **500 Ivory** per trade and has a **10% chance** of yielding a megalith, provided the player has reached an **Embassy level of 15**.

### **Primary Use: Ziggurats**
The most critical application of megaliths is building [Ziggurats]( {{< relref "buildings/Ziggurat.md" >}}), which cost **50 Megaliths**, 50 Scaffolds, and 1 Blueprint each. 
*   **Unlocks:** Ziggurats are the gateway to the **unicorn religion** system, enabling the sacrifice of unicorns to obtain **Unicorn Tears**.
*   **Culture Boost:** Each Ziggurat provides a **+8% increase to maximum culture**.
*   **Visibility:** While unlocked by the [Construction]( {{< relref "techs/Construction.md" >}}) technology, the Ziggurat will not appear in the Bonfire tab until the player possesses approximately **5 Megaliths**, 5 Scaffolds, and 1 Blueprint.

### **Endgame and Religious Structures**
In the late game, megaliths are a mandatory component for advanced structures within the [Cryptotheology]( {{< relref "techs/Cryptotheology.md" >}}) and unicorn trees:
*   [Sky Palace:]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Sky_Palace.md" >}}) 5 Megaliths.
*   [Marker:]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Marker.md" >}}) 750 Megaliths.
*   [Unicorn Graveyard:]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Unicorn_Graveyard.md" >}}) 1,000 Megaliths.
*   [Unicorn Necropolis:]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Unicorn_Necropolis.md" >}}) 2,500 Megaliths.
*   [Black Pyramid:]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Black_Pyramid.md" >}}) 2,500 Megaliths.

### **Strategic Considerations**
Strategic guides recommend building a significant number of Ziggurats (ideally **25–30**) before heavily investing in unicorn sacrifices, as the number of tears received per sacrifice is directly determined by the total number of Ziggurats owned. 

### **Persistence and Resets**
As a crafted resource, megaliths are **normally lost upon resetting** the game. To carry them over into a new run, a player must have at least one [Chronosphere]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}) and the [Flux Condensator]( {{< relref "upgrade/Flux_Condensator.md" >}}) Workshop upgrade. The amount preserved follows a square root formula based on the total quantity held before the reset.
