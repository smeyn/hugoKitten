[T-Mythril]( {{< relref "craft/T-Mythril.md" >}}) is a late-game craftable resource in *Kittens Game*, specifically associated with the Zebra civilisation structures and resource conversion.

### Acquisition and Crafting

T-Mythril crafting is unlocked by constructing the [Zebra Forge]( {{< relref "buildings/Zebra_Forge.md" >}}) building.

The resource cost to craft T-Mythril is high, involving advanced resources, unicorn resources, and titanium:
*   **5 Bloodstone**
*   **1,000 Ivory**
*   **500 Titanium**

The [Zebra Forge]( {{< relref "buildings/Zebra_Forge.md" >}}) itself is a major structure, costing 50 Bloodstone, and is necessary to unlock the ability to craft both T-Mythril and Bloodstone.

### Uses in Infrastructure

T-Mythril is primarily used to build the [Ivory Temple]( {{< relref "buildings/Ivory_Temple.md" >}}):

*   **Ivory Temple Cost:** 1 T-Mythril and 100 Ivory.
*   **Effect:** The Ivory Temple serves as a resource converter, continuously consuming **100 Ivory per tick** and producing **1 Mineral per tick**.
*   **Automation:** The Ivory Temple structure also has an automation upgrade (Whispers) that doubles both ivory consumption and mineral production, while also generating a minuscule amount of T-Mythril (0.00005 per tick).
