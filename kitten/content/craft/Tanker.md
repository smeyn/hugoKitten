A [Tanker]( {{< relref "craft/Tanker.md" >}}) is a high-tier craftable resource in *Kittens Game* primarily used to expand your colony's maximum **Oil** storage capacity. Each Tanker built provides a flat increase of **+500 to the oil cap**.

### **Acquisition and Cost**
Tankers are unlocked by researching [Robotics]( {{< relref "techs/Robotics.md" >}}). Because they require a significant amount of materials, they are considered a relatively expensive method of increasing storage. The crafting cost for a single Tanker is:
*   **200 Trade Ships**
*   **1250 Alloy**
*   **5 Blueprints**

### **Strategic Utility and Advice**
While Tankers provide a reliable way to boost your oil limit, strategic guides offer specific warnings regarding their efficiency:
*   **The Oil Well Alternative:** In some stages of the game (specifically during the Iron Will 40k run), relying on Tankers to reach oil caps is often deemed **suboptimal**. It is generally recommended to focus on grinding out the [Steel]( {{< relref "craft/Steel.md" >}}) necessary to build more [Oil Wells]( {{< relref "buildings/Oil_Well.md" >}}) instead, as they are often more resource-effective for reaching cap requirements.
*   **Automation:** Once you have Engineers, you can assign them to **automatically craft Tankers** (as well as Kerosene) to prevent your oil from capping and production from halting while you are away from the game.

### **Preservation and Resets**
As a crafted resource, Tankers are **normally lost upon resetting** the game. However, they can be preserved across runs if the player has:
1.  [Chronospheres:]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}) At least one active Chronosphere.
2.  [Flux Condensator:]( {{< relref "upgrade/Flux_Condensator.md" >}}) This workshop upgrade allows Chronospheres to carry over a portion of crafted resources, including Tankers. 

The amount preserved is calculated as a fraction based on the number of Chronospheres and the square root of the quantity of Tankers possessed prior to the reset. This makes them vital for "Positive Resets" in the late game, where players aim to start a new run with high storage capacities already intact.
