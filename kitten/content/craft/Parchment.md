[Parchment]( {{< relref "craft/Parchment.md" >}}) is a vital mid-game craftable resource in *Kittens Game* that serves as the foundation for your colony’s cultural and religious expansion. It is primarily used to construct culture-generating buildings and to craft more advanced intellectual resources.

### **Acquisition and Crafting**
*   **Unlocking:** You gain the ability to craft parchment after researching the [Writing]( {{< relref "techs/Writing.md" >}}) technology (3,600 Science).
*   **Workshop Crafting:** A single unit of parchment is crafted from **175 Furs** in the Workshop. 
*   [Trading:]( {{< relref "guides/trading.md" >}}) Once you reach **Embassy level 5** with the [Sharks]( {{< relref "trade/Sharks.md" >}}), they have a 25% chance of selling you parchment in exchange for iron. This chance can be increased by **+25%** if you enact the **Shark Relations: Scribes** policy.
*   **Automation:** While there is no direct early-game automation for parchment itself, maximizing your [Workshops]( {{< relref "buildings/Workshop.md" >}}) provides a multiplicative boost to the number of parchments produced per craft.

### **Primary Uses**
Parchment is a mandatory requirement for transitioning out of the early game and establishing a "cultural engine":
*   **Resource Conversion:** It is the primary input for crafting [Manuscripts]( {{< relref "resource/manuscript.md" >}}). Each manuscript requires **25 parchment** (reduced to **20** with the [Tradition]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}) policy).
*   **Building Construction:** It is a required material for several essential structures:
    *   [Amphitheatres:]( {{< relref "buildings/Amphitheatre.md" >}}) 3 Parchment (essential for reducing unhappiness and generating early culture).
    *   [Chapels:]( {{< relref "buildings/Chapel.md" >}}) 250 Parchment (the primary structure for generating faith).
    *   **Breweries:** 375 Parchment (required for holding festivals).
*   **Scientific Research:** A massive stockpile of **5,000 parchment** is required to research [Drama and Poetry]( {{< relref "techs/Drama_and_Poetry.md" >}}), which enables the festival system.

### **Strategic Management**
*   **Early-Game Grind:** Strategic guides recommend beginning to craft parchment **as often as possible** once the Workshop is unlocked, as you will need vast quantities for the "Theology hurdle".
*   **The "Hunter Dump" Strategy:** To efficiently accumulate parchment before automation is available, players should temporarily reassign all kittens to the [Hunter]( {{< relref "job/Hunter.md" >}}) job. This allows you to mass-produce the furs necessary for a bulk parchment craft session.
*   **Policy Synergy:** Enacting the [Tradition]( {{< relref "Policy/Tradition.md" >}}) policy is highly recommended because it reduces the parchment cost for manuscripts and doubles their cultural effectiveness, significantly speeding up mid-game scientific progress.

### **Special Constraints**
*   **Pacifism Challenge:** In this challenge, hunting is disabled. You cannot obtain furs, and therefore cannot craft parchment, until you build a [Mint]( {{< relref "buildings/Mint.md" >}}) to generate a passive supply of luxury resources.
*   **Iron Will:** Since you lack kittens for standard jobs in this mode, your parchment supply depends entirely on the furs gathered by [Zebras]( {{< relref "trade/zebras.md" >}}) acting as passive hunters.
*   **Persistence:** As a crafted resource, parchment is **lost upon resetting** the game unless you possess [Chronospheres]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}) and the [Flux Condensator]( {{< relref "upgrade/Flux_Condensator.md" >}}) workshop upgrade.
