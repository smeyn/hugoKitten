+++
**Refining catnip** is the primary method for producing **wood** during the early stages of the game before kittens can be assigned as woodcutters. The "Refine catnip" button appears in the Left UI once the colony has accumulated at least **100 catnip**.

### **Conversion and Efficiency**
*   **Base Rate:** Initially, the conversion rate is **100 catnip for 1 wood**.
*   **Cost Reduction:** Researching [Catnip Enrichment]( {{< relref "upgrade/Catnip_Enrichment.md" >}}) in the Workshop reduces the cost to **50 catnip per unit of wood**.
*   **Effectiveness Bonuses:** While this process **does not benefit from standard crafting bonuses**, its output can be increased through specific structures and Policy/.
    *   [Bio Labs:]( {{< relref "buildings/Bio_Lab.md" >}}) Each lab increases catnip refinement effectiveness by **10%**.
    *   **Shark Relations (Botanists):** This foreign policy provides a **+25% wood crafting bonus**.

### **Iron Will Strategies**
In **Iron Will** mode, where kitten housing is forbidden, refining catnip is the essential source of wood for early infrastructure like **Libraries**. Several mode-specific bonuses help scale this production:
*   [Lumber Mills:]( {{< relref "buildings/Lumber_Mill.md" >}}) In Iron Will, these buildings provide a **+10% bonus** to catnip refinement rather than boosting woodcutter output.
*   **Clear Cutting Policy:** This environmental policy provides a **+10% refinement bonus**, functioning similarly to an un-upgraded Lumber Mill.
*   **Open Woodlands Policy:** This provides a smaller **+4.16% bonus** to refinement.

### **Strategic Utility**
*   **Early Game:** Players are encouraged to refine catnip five times to reach the **5 wood** required to build their first [Hut]( {{< relref "buildings/Hut.md" >}}), which unlocks the village system.
*   **Production Balancing:** Because Catnip Fields suffer a **-75% production penalty during Winter**, players must ensure their food supply is stable before aggressively refining their stores into wood. 
*   **Trade Loops:** In some mid-game strategies, players trade **Iron to the Sharks** for massive amounts of catnip, which is then refined into wood to be traded to [Griffins]( {{< relref "trade/Griffins.md" >}}) for more Iron.
