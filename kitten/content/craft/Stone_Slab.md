A [Stone Slab]( {{< relref "craft/Stone_Slab.md" >}}) (often simply called a **Slab**) is a foundational mid-game craftable resource refined from minerals. Each slab is produced in the Workshop at a base cost of **250 Minerals**.

### **Acquisition and Automation**
Beyond manual crafting, slabs can be acquired through several channels:
*   **Trading with Nagas:** The Nagas have a **75% base chance** to sell 5 slabs per trade in exchange for ivory.
*   **Currency for Zebras:** Slabs serve as the **primary trade currency for the Zebras**, who buy 50 slabs per successful trade to provide iron, metal plates, and titanium.
*   **Steamworks Automation:** Researching [Workshop Automation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Workshop_Automation.md" >}}) allows Steamworks to automatically convert minerals into slabs once per year whenever minerals reach 98% of their storage cap. This frequency increases to twice per year with [Advanced Automation]( {{< relref "upgrade/Advanced_Automation.md" >}}).

### **Construction and Crafting Uses**
Slabs are a mandatory material for a vast array of essential infrastructure and higher-tier resources:
*   **Storage Buildings:** [Warehouses]( {{< relref "buildings/Warehouse.md" >}}) (2 slabs) and [Harbours]( {{< relref "buildings/Harbour.md" >}}) (50).
*   **Scientific Facilities:** **Observatories** (35), [Bio Labs]( {{< relref "buildings/Bio_Lab.md" >}}) (100), and **Data Centres** (upgraded from Libraries).
*   **Industrial and Religious Buildings:** **Quarries** (1000), [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}) (25), and [Mansions]( {{< relref "buildings/Mansion.md" >}}) (185).
*   **Resource Conversion:** Slabs are required to craft [Megaliths]( {{< relref "craft/Megalith.md" >}}) (50 slabs) and [Concrete]( {{< relref "craft/Concrete.md" >}}) (2500 slabs).

### **Strategic Enhancements**
Players can optimize slab production through specific Policy/ and technology paths:
*   **Masons Policy:** Enacting the **Naga Relations: Masons** policy provides a **+2.5% Quarry slab crafting bonus**.
*   **Titanium Era:** Slabs are considered a high priority during the transition to space, as they are the gating resource required to discovery Zebras and begin mass-acquiring titanium.
*   **Iron Will Mode:** In this specialized mode, the ability to craft slabs is unlocked once you have established **5 Naga Embassies**.

### **Persistence and Resets**
As a crafted resource, stone slabs are **lost upon resetting** the game by default. To carry them over into a new run, a player must possess at least one [Chronosphere]( {{< relref "buildings/Chronosphere.md" >}}) and the [Flux Condensator]( {{< relref "upgrade/Flux_Condensator.md" >}}) Workshop upgrade. The amount preserved follows a formula based on the number of active chronospheres and the **square root** of the total quantity held before the reset.
