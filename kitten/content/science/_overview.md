Science is a critical resource in *Kittens Game*, essential for technological advancement, unlocking new capabilities, and progressing to later stages of the game [1-3].

Here is an explanation of how Science is acquired, its uses, and how its capacity is managed:

### Acquisition and Production

Science is categorized as a **Special Resource** [3]. Its accumulation is boosted by global factors, including **Paragon** and **Religion production boosts** [4].

1.  **Kitten Jobs:** Science is primarily generated by the **Scholar** profession [3, 5, 6]. You should employ Scholars to ensure continuous accumulation, as Techs are crucial for progression [1].
2.  **Buildings:** Science production is generated by several buildings:
    *   **Library** (unlocked at 25 Wood) [5, 7]: Provides +10% Science per tick [7].
    *   **Academy** (unlocked by Mathematics) [7, 8]: Provides +20% Science per tick [7].
    *   **Observatory** (unlocked by Astronomy) [7]: Provides +25% Science per tick [7].
    *   **Bio Lab** (unlocked by Biology) [7]: Provides +35% Science per tick [7].
    *   **Data Center**: An upgrade to the Library, it also provides +10% Science per tick [9].
3.  **Events:** You can gain Science by observing **astronomical events** [10, 11]. After building your first Library, these events have a chance to occur daily [11]. Meteors also grant minerals and science [10, 12]. The **Celestial Mechanics** upgrade grants an additional **20% bonus** to science generated by celestial events and meteors (60% bonus in Iron Will mode) [13].
4.  **Policies:** Policies such as **Rationality** (+5% science production) [14] and **Knowledge Sharing** (+5% science income) [15] can increase accumulation rates.

### Usage and Role in Progression

Science is essential for expanding your civilization by unlocking new content [1].

1.  **Purchasing Technologies (Techs):** Science is spent to purchase Techs, which grant new information and abilities [1, 3]. Techs must generally be unlocked in sequence, and they are crucial for game progression [1]. However, the cost of sciences escalates very quickly, and players should avoid prioritizing new sciences too aggressively before securing production and caps [16].
2.  **Crafting Advanced Resources:** Science is required in the Workshop tab for converting intermediate resources into higher-tier resources [3, 17, 18]:
    *   **Compendium:** Crafted from 50 **Manuscripts** and **10,000 Science** [17, 18]. Compendiums improve the maximum science limit [17].
    *   **Blueprint:** Crafted from 25 **Compendiums** and **25,000 Science** [17, 18]. Blueprints are required for late-game technologies and automated industry buildings like the Steamworks [17, 19].
3.  **Workshop Upgrades:** Science is a resource used to buy various permanent upgrades in the Workshop tab [3].

### Science Capacity and Storage

All resources, including Science, have a maximum storage limit (cap) [20, 21]. Reaching this limit can greatly slow progress [2]. Science has a default maximum capacity of **250** [21].

The maximum Science storage (cap) can be increased by various structures and upgrades:

*   **Libraries, Academies, and Labs:**
    *   **Library:** +250 Max Science [7].
    *   **Academy:** +500 Max Science [7].
    *   **Observatory:** +1000 Max Science [7].
    *   **Bio Lab:** +1500 Max Science [7].
    *   **Data Center** (upgraded Library): +750 Max Science [9].
*   **Upgrades and Policies:**
    *   **LHC** (unlocked by Dimensional Physics): Grants **+2,500 Max Science per Accelerator** [22, 23].
    *   **Technocracy** policy (Government tree): Increases science cap by **+20%** [24].
    *   **Titanium Reflectors, Unobtainium Reflectors, Eludium Reflectors:** These upgrades, linked to Observatories, increase the maximum science bonus of Libraries/Data Centers by **2% per Observatory** [7, 13].
    *   **Uplink/Starlink:** These upgrades cause Data Centers and Bio Labs to provide bonuses to each other's maximum science capacity [25].
