The term [Philosophy]( {{< relref "philosophy.md" >}}) in *Kittens Game* refers to a critical mid-early game technology that unlocks essential progression paths, as well as a subsequent category of policies that govern societal beliefs regarding luxury and endurance.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Philosophy technology and its associated policies:

## 1. Philosophy as a Technology

[Philosophy]( {{< relref "philosophy.md" >}}) is a specialist science research that becomes available after you have researched [Writing]( {{< relref "writing.md" >}}).

| Detail | Information | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | **9,500 Science**. | |
| **Prerequisite** | [Writing]( {{< relref "writing.md" >}}). | |
| **Key Unlock (Tech)** | [Theology]( {{< relref "theology.md" >}}). | |
| **Key Unlock (Building)** | [Temple]( {{< relref "temple.md" >}}). | |
| **Main Effect** | Enables the creation of [compendiums]( {{< relref "resource/Compendium.md" >}}). | |

### Compendiums
Compendiums are a crucial craftable resource unlocked by Philosophy.

*   **Purpose:** They are composite documents required for subsequent technological advancement. Every compendium created provides **+10 to max science**, though this bonus cannot exceed the maximum science cap derived from buildings.
*   **Crafting:** A compendium is crafted in the Workshop by combining **50 Manuscripts** and **10,000 Science**.

### Strategic Importance

There is conflicting advice in the sources regarding when to prioritize the Philosophy technology:

*   **Walkthrough Advice:** The "Kittens Game" walkthrough suggests that among the three technologies unlocked by Writing (**Philosophy, Machinery, and Steel**), you should choose **Philosophy to start** because it is the cheapest and keeps you on the main path of advancement.
*   **Expert Advice:** The "Monstrous Advice" column recommends prioritizing [Steel]( {{< relref "steel.md" >}}) and [Machinery]( {{< relref "machinery.md" >}}) first to strengthen your economy and automate manuscripts, and then taking [Philosophy]( {{< relref "philosophy.md" >}}) last, specifically so you will have ways to make all the manuscripts needed to build Temples.

After researching Philosophy, you will immediately face a "fair bump" because the subsequent technology, Theology, has "fairly steep requirements" involving manuscripts and culture.

## 2. Philosophy as a Policy Category

Philosophy is one of the four categories of policies (along with Government, Foreign, and Environment) that defines your society's path in certain areas.

The main policy choices unlocked once the [Philosophy]( {{< relref "philosophy.md" >}}) technology has been researched are [Stoicism]( {{< relref "stoicism.md" >}}) and **Epicureanism**.

### Stoicism vs. Epicureanism

Both policies cost **2,500 Culture** and lock out the other choice.

| Policy | Description & Effect | Prerequisite & Progression |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Stoicism]( {{< relref "stoicism.md" >}}) | Teaches endurance without complaint. **Effect:** Halves the consumption of luxury resources (Fur, Ivory, and Spice are consumed 50% slower), and reduces Brewery consumption by 25%. | This policy unlocks the choice between [Frugality]( {{< relref "frugality.md" >}}) and [Rationing]( {{< relref "rationing.md" >}}) later on. |
| **Epicureanism** | Believes pleasure is the highest good. **Effect:** Luxury resources provide **11% happiness each** (instead of the base 10%). | This policy unlocks the choice between [Carnivale]( {{< relref "carnivale.md" >}}) and [Extravagance]( {{< relref "extravagance.md" >}}) later on. |

Expert advice suggests preferring **Epicureanism** for the extra happiness boost, noting that Stoicism addresses a problem (managing luxury consumption) that should ideally be manageable by the time the policy is available through hunting and trade upgrades. Choosing either Epicureanism or Stoicism is a prerequisite for subsequent philosophical choices like [Rationality]( {{< relref "rationality.md" >}}) or [Mysticism]( {{< relref "mysticism.md" >}}).
