[Steel]( {{< relref "steel.md" >}}) in *Kittens Game* functions as both a crucial mid-game technology required for industrial expansion and as a valuable crafted resource necessary for advanced construction and automation.

### 1. Technology Overview and Cost

The [Steel]( {{< relref "steel.md" >}}) technology is unlocked in the Science tab once you have researched [Writing]( {{< relref "writing.md" >}}).

*   **Cost:** It requires **12,000 Science**.
*   **Context:** Steel is one of three key technologies (alongside [Philosophy]( {{< relref "philosophy.md" >}}) and [Machinery]( {{< relref "machinery.md" >}})) that become available after researching Writing.
*   **Unlocks:** Researching Steel unlocks the ability to craft steel, and also grants access to several specialized Workshop Upgrades.

### 2. Steel as a Resource and its Production

Steel is a **craftable resource**.

*   **Crafting Recipe:** Steel is created in the Workshop by combining **100 Iron** and **100 Coal**.
*   **Resource Role:** It is a durable metal required for the construction of **gears and complex machinery**.
*   **Acquisition via Trade:** Steel can also be acquired through trade, as the [Griffins]( {{< relref "trade/Griffins.md" >}}) sell Steel (25 units per trade). In the Iron Will 40K endless run guide, the Sharks and Griffins trading loop is cited as a great way to start collecting steel.

### 3. Key Upgrades Unlocked by Steel

Researching the Steel technology immediately enables several important upgrades in the Workshop:

*   **Resource Production:**
    *   [Steel Axe:]( {{< relref "steel_axe.md" >}}) Permanently increases Woodcutter output by 50%.
    *   [Coal Furnace:]( {{< relref "coal_furnace.md" >}}) Allows Smelters to produce Coal (0.005 coal/tick) while operating.
    *   [Deep Mining:]( {{< relref "deep_mining.md" >}}) Allows Mines to produce Coal (0.003 coal/tick).
    *   [High Pressure Engine:]( {{< relref "high_pressure_engine.md" >}}) Reduces the Coal consumption of Steamworks by 20%.
*   **Storage and Hunting:**
    *   [Reinforced Warehouses:]( {{< relref "reinforced_warehouses.md" >}}) Increases the storage space for common resources (wood, minerals, coal, iron, gold, and titanium) from Warehouses, Barns, Harbors, and Mints by 25%.
    *   [Steel Armour:]( {{< relref "steel_armour.md" >}}) Provides a permanent **+0.5 Hunting bonus** to increase resource yields from hunting.

### 4. Strategic Importance and Use

Steel is a required component for many major buildings and subsequent technological advancements:

*   **Buildings Requiring Steel:**
    *   [Steamworks:]( {{< relref "steamworks.md" >}}) The crucial automation building (requires 65 Steel).
    *   [Mansion:]( {{< relref "mansion.md" >}}) A later housing upgrade.
    *   [Quarry:]( {{< relref "quarry.md" >}}) A resource building (requires 125 Steel).
    *   [Calciner:]( {{< relref "calciner.md" >}}) An industry building.
    *   [Data Center:]( {{< relref "data_center.md" >}}) An upgraded Science building (requires 100 Steel).
*   **Crafting Requirements:** Steel is needed to craft [Gears]( {{< relref "craft/Gear.md" >}}) and is a component in making [Alloy]( {{< relref "alloy.md" >}}).
*   **Conflicting Advice:**
    *   The "Monstrous Advice" column recommends prioritizing **Steel first** among the three post-Writing technologies, specifically to gain the useful upgrades that strengthen your economy, before moving to Machinery and Philosophy.
    *   Conversely, the walkthrough advises considering Steel a "specialist Tech" and suggests prioritizing [Philosophy]( {{< relref "philosophy.md" >}}) because it is cheaper and maintains forward progression.
*   **Resource Management:** In early runs, after acquiring the initial Workshop upgrades unlocked by Steel, players are often advised to **ignore coal and let it max out**, dedicating their iron production to building Lumber Mills and Observatories, as Steel quickly becomes a bottleneck for future construction.

Steel acts as the foundation for the next stage of industrial complexity, marking the point where your civilization transitions from basic resource gathering to automated production and advanced crafting. This reliance on Steel leads directly into the Machinery era, as Steel is required for the construction of the Steamworks.
