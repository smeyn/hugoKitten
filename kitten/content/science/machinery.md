The research of **Machinery** is a mid-early game scientific milestone unlocked by **Writing**, and its primary purpose is to introduce **automation** and **industrial production** to your civilization.

It is considered a specialist technology, costing **15,000 Science**.

Here is a breakdown of what Machinery unlocks and its strategic importance:

### 1. Key Building: Steamworks

The most significant unlock is the **Steamworks** building.

*   **Function:** Steamworks consume Coal in exchange for creating a variety of handy items. It provides +1 Energy.
*   **Requirements:** Steamworks are themselves a hurdle, requiring **Steel**, **Gears**, and a **Blueprint** to create.

### 2. Key Upgrades for Automation and Production

Machinery unlocks three important upgrades in the Workshop tab:

| Upgrade | Purpose | Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Printing Press** | **Manuscript Automation** | Allows Steamworks to automatically print **Manuscripts** (at a rate of 0.0025 manuscripts/sec). Manuscripts are required for subsequent advanced technologies like Theology and Astronomy. |
| **Workshop Automation** | **Resource Conversion** | Converts a percentage of wood (to beams) and minerals (to slabs) once per year when those resources are at 98% of their storage cap. |
| **Crossbow** | **Catpower Boost** | Provides a permanent **25% boost to the catpower production** generated by Hunters. |

### 3. Strategic Context

Machinery is part of a trio of important technologies unlocked by Writing (alongside **Philosophy** and **Steel**).

*   **Expert Advice:** One set of advice suggests prioritizing **Steel** first (to gain useful economic upgrades), then immediately moving to **Machinery** to utilize the hunting upgrade and gain automatic manuscript production, and finally researching **Philosophy**.
*   **Walkthrough Advice:** Conversely, the walkthrough suggests **Machinery** and **Steel** are "specialist Techs that won’t help you much right now" and recommends pursuing **Philosophy** first as it is the cheapest and keeps you on the main path of advancement. However, utilizing the Printing Press enabled by Machinery is key to overcoming the future hurdle of generating Manuscripts for Theology.
