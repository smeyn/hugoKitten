[Theology]( {{< relref "science/Theology.md" >}}) is a pivotal science technology in *Kittens Game* that marks a significant transition point in the civilization's progression, particularly by introducing the **Religion** system.

### Prerequisites and Cost

Theology is unlocked in the Science tab after researching [Philosophy]( {{< relref "science/Philosophy.md" >}}). Reaching this science is noted as a "fair bump" because it has steep requirements that force the player to establish production systems for specialized resources.

The cost to research Theology is:

*   [Science:]( {{< relref "resource/science.md" >}}) 20,000
*   [Manuscripts:]( {{< relref "resource/manuscript.md" >}}) 35

This Manuscripts requirement involves grinding out resources, as Manuscripts must be crafted from [Parchment]( {{< relref "craft/Parchment.md" >}}) (derived from Furs, acquired through Hunting) and [Culture]( {{< relref "resource/culture.md" >}}) (generated by buildings like Amphitheatres and Temples). Overcoming this hurdle will likely take a long time.

### Effects and Unlocks

Upon successful research, Theology provides several immediate unlocks crucial for advancing the civilization:

1.  **New Resource and Production:** Theology unlocks the generation of [Faith]( {{< relref "resource/faith.md" >}}), a new expendable resource used primarily in the Religion tab.
    *   It enables the [Priest]( {{< relref "job/Priest.md" >}}) profession. Kittens assigned as Priests initially produce **0.0015 faith per tick**.
    *   It enables [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}) to generate Faith, specifically at a rate of **0.0015 faith per tick** per Temple.

2.  **New Systems:**
    *   It unlocks the **Religion tab**.
    *   It unlocks the ability to build [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}) (which were already unlocked by Philosophy, but Theology makes them functional for Faith).
    *   It unlocks the **Order of the Sun**, the religious upgrade system.

### Importance in Progression

Theology is crucial because it gates access to the next stages of technological and religious development:

*   **Religious Upgrades:** It allows the player to start investing Faith in religious upgrades by using the "Praise the sun!" option to gain Worship. Religious upgrades, such as [Scholasticism]( {{< relref "religion/Scholasticism.md" >}}) (which lets Temples boost Science maximum capacity by +500) and [Sun Altar]( {{< relref "religion/Sun_Altar.md" >}}) (which contributes to Happiness), affect areas outside of the Religion system.
*   **Scientific Path:** Theology unlocks the pathway to the next major sciences, [Astronomy]( {{< relref "techs/Astronomy.md" >}}) and [Cryptotheology]( {{< relref "techs/Cryptotheology.md" >}}).
*   **Manuscript Reliance:** Once Theology is researched, future sciences, such as Astronomy (requiring 65 Manuscripts), will also require Manuscripts, making efficient Culture and Parchment production essential for continued technological growth.
