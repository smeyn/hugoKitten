Happiness is a critical game mechanic that directly influences the productivity and **overall efficiency of your Kittens in their work**. The higher the level of happiness, the better the results of their labour.

However, happiness can become a hindrance, as it is considered a **production killer until you have enough Amphitheaters**. As the population grows, Kittens become **unhappy**, and this affects overall production.

### Sources and Effects of Happiness

#### Positive Sources (Boosts)

1.  **Rare Resources:** Rare resources (Furs, Ivory, and Spice) provide a happiness bonus. Hunting accumulates Furs and Ivory, which serves the purpose of **increasing Happiness**. Each rare resource, when consumed, gives **+10% to happiness**. Mints, which generate rare resources, also help boost happiness and therefore production. The Epicureanism policy can increase the happiness gained from rare resources to **11%** each, and the Extravagance policy increases happiness from consumable luxury resources by 5.
2.  **Karma:** Karma, which is gained upon resetting the game (if you have more than 35 kittens), increases happiness, making your kittens **happier and thus more productive**.
3.  **Buildings and Upgrades:**
    *   **Amphitheatres** are crucial for the early game as they help **reduce unhappiness** caused by rising population.
    *   The religious upgrade **Sun Altar** (unlocked via the Order of the Sun) provides **+0.5% happiness** from Temples, with additional levels available through Transcendence.
    *   Sacrificing unicorns for a unicorn tear grants a **happiness/production bonus**.
    *   A single **Broadcast Tower** can replace your entire stock of Amphitheaters for happiness purposes.
4.  **Policies and Policy Effects:**
    *   The **Liberty** policy increases the production effect of happiness by **10%** and grants free housing for one kitten.
    *   The **Environmentalism** policy provides a **+3% happiness** effect.
    *   The **Conservation** policy increases happiness by **+5%**.
    *   The **Fascism** policy eliminates population penalties to happiness.

#### Negative Sources (Penalties)

1.  **Population Growth:** As population rises, kittens become **unhappy**.
2.  **Pollution:** A high level of pollution in the atmosphere **negatively affects your kittens** and **reduces your happiness**.
3.  **Policies:** Certain policies increase happiness penalties, such as **Strip Mining** and **Clear Cutting**, which both incur a **-2% happiness** penalty. The **Sustainability** policy can be used later to remove this happiness penalty.
4.  **Challenges:** Running the **Atheism** challenge decreases happiness by **0.5** for each run completed after the first.

### Management

To maintain a healthy, productive population, it is crucial to keep your Happiness **nice and high**. Players are advised to build Amphitheatres until they stop noticeably improving Happiness, as monitored by the **‘population penalty’ percentage** on the top bar of the game. Trade Depots decrease the consumption rate of rare resources (luxuries).
