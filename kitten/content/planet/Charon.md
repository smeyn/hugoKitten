[Charon]( {{< relref "planet/Charon.md" >}}) refers to a late-game deep space mission destination and is also one of the ten astronomical cycles in the *Kittens Game* time system.

### 1. Charon Space Mission

The Charon Mission targets a small, dense, and distant dwarf planet located on the far edge of the Helios system, sometimes grimly referred to as 'The Gates of Death'.

| Detail | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prerequisite** | Unlocked after completing the [Umbra Mission]( {{< relref "space/Umbra_Mission.md" >}}). |
| **Cost** | 75,000 Starchart, 750,000 Science, 35,000 Kerosene, and 35,000 Thorium. |
| **Travel Time** | 25,000 game-days, which equals 13 hours, 53 minutes, and 20 seconds in real-time. Travel time can be significantly reduced by researching drive upgrades such as the Antimatter Drive and Thorium Drive. |
| **Unlocks** | Successful completion unlocks the **Charon Planet**. |

### 2. Charon Astrological Cycle

Charon ($\text{⍙}$) is one of the ten planetary cycles, each lasting five years. Its effects are triggered upon researching advanced Metaphysics upgrades:

*   **With Numerology:** The cycle negatively impacts specific structures related to Unobtainium (UO) and gigaflops:
    *   [Lunar Outpost]( {{< relref "planet/lunar_outpost.md" >}}) unobtainium output is decreased by **$-10\%$**.
    *   **Entanglement Station** gigaflops consumption is increased by **$+100\%$**.
*   **Festival Effect (With Numeromancy):** If a festival is held during the Charon cycle, it provides a $\times 1.5$ multiplier to **Catnip, Wood, and Mineral income**.

The severe penalty to Lunar Outpost production during the Charon cycle is notable, especially when compared to the highly advantageous Redmoon cycle, which boosts UO production by $+20\%$. Due to this, strategies often revolve around skipping non-profitable cycles, like Charon, using time manipulation.
