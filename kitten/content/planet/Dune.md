[Dune]( {{< relref "planet/Dune.md" >}}) ($\text{⍫}$) is a pivotal mid-to-late-game space destination, a planet in the Cath solar system, which unlocks new industrial structures and is tied to a specific astrological cycle that boosts uranium production.

### 1. Dune Space Mission Details

Dune is described as a large, lifeless planet covered by sand and volcanic rock. The Dune Mission is unlocked after successfully completing the Moon Mission.

| Detail | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prerequisite** | Moon Mission |
| **Cost** | 1000 Starchart, 7000 Titanium, 175k Science, and 75 Kerosene |
| **Travel Time** | 356 game-days (11 minutes, 52 seconds in real-time) |
| **Unlocks** | Helios mission |

### 2. Key Structures and Policy/ Unlocked

Successful completion of the mission unlocks the Dune Planet and critical infrastructure:

*   [Planet Cracker:]( {{< relref "space/planet_cracker.md" >}}) A vessel that generates Uranium (1.5/sec). Building this structure requires a significant investment in Starcharts: 1000 Starchart to reach Dune, and 2500 Starchart to build the cracker itself.
*   **Hydraulic Fracturer:** A structure that produces Oil (2.5/sec). Hydraulic Fracturers are generally not particularly effective until the [Space Manufacturing]( {{< relref "upgrade/Space_Manufacturing.md" >}}) upgrade is secured.
*   [Spice Refinery:]( {{< relref "space/spice_refinery.md" >}}) Refines Dune sand into 'Spice' at a rate of 0.125/sec.

Reaching Dune is also a prerequisite for unlocking several high-level Government Policy/, including [Technocracy]( {{< relref "Policy/Technocracy.md" >}}), [Cosmological Libertarianism]( {{< relref "Policy/Cosmological_Libertarianism.md" >}}), and [Order of the Stars]( {{< relref "Policy/Order_of_the_Stars.md" >}}).

### 3. Dune Astrological Cycle

Dune ($\text{⍫}$) is one of the ten cycles in the game's time system, with each cycle lasting five years. The effects of this cycle are leveraged by researching Metaphysics upgrades like Numerology and Numeromancy:

*   **With Numerology:** The cycle provides significant production bonuses for resources generated on Dune: it increases **Planet Cracker uranium output by +10%** and **Hydraulic Fracturer oil output by +50%**. Conversely, it imposes a penalty on HR Harvester Energy Production (-25%).
*   **With Numeromancy (Festival Bonus):** Holding a festival during the Dune cycle grants a $\times 2$ multiplier to **Uranium income**.
