[Umbra]( {{< relref "planet/Umbra.md" >}}) refers to both a deep space destination reachable via a mission and a recurring astrological cycle that impacts your production in *Kittens Game*.

### 1. Umbra Cycle (Time System)

Umbra is one of the ten cycles featured in the game's time system, identified by the glyph $\text{⍦}$. Each cycle lasts for five years.

When the appropriate technologies are researched, the Umbra cycle provides specific bonuses and penalties:

*   **With Numerology:** The cycle affects production from specific space structures:
    *   The uranium output of the [Planet Cracker]( {{< relref "space/planet_cracker.md" >}}) is decreased by $-10\%$.
    *   The oil output of the **Hydraulic Fracturer** is decreased by $-25\%$.
    *   The **HR Harvester** Energy Production is increased by $+50\%$.
*   **With Numeromancy (Festival Bonus):** Holding a festival during the Umbra cycle grants a $1.5\times$ income multiplier for Coal, Iron, Titanium, and Gold.

### 2. Umbra Mission and HR Harvester

Umbra is a destination in deep space, described as a supermassive black hole at the heart of the Helios system.

*   **Mission Cost and Prerequisite:** The [Umbra Mission]( {{< relref "space/Umbra_Mission.md" >}}) is unlocked after the [Yarn Mission]( {{< relref "space/Yarn_Mission.md" >}}). It is a high-cost mission, requiring:
    *   25,000 Starchart
    *   500k Science
    *   25k Kerosene
    *   15k Thorium
*   **Travel Time:** The journey to Umbra takes 7,600 game-days, equivalent to 4 hours, 13 minutes, and 20 seconds in real-time.
*   **Building Unlocked:** The successful mission unlocks the **Umbra Planet** and the **HR Harvester** building. The HR Harvester operates on the energy of the black hole evaporation to generate energy. This energy production starts at $1\text{W}$ and slowly increases over time.
*   **Progression:** The Umbra Mission subsequently unlocks the [Charon Mission]( {{< relref "space/Charon_Mission.md" >}}).
