[Helios]( {{< relref "planet/Helios.md" >}}) refers to a pivotal deep space mission destination—a G2V spectral type star in the centre of the Cath solar system—and a recurring astrological cycle. It is also the designated goal for one of the game's major challenges.

Here is a detailed breakdown of Helios:

### 1. Helios Space Mission

The Helios mission is a significant undertaking that occurs in the mid-to-late game, following the Dune Mission.

| Detail | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prerequisite** | Unlocked after the Dune Mission (also unlocked by the T-minus Mission). |
| **Cost** | 3,000 Starchart, 15,000 Titanium, 250k Science, and 1,250 Kerosene. |
| **Travel Time** | 1,200 game-days, which is 40 minutes in real-time. |
| **Structures Unlocked** | Successful completion unlocks high-tier structures needed for antimatter and storage capacity: [Sunlifter]( {{< relref "space/sunlifter.md" >}}), **Containment Chamber**, **Heatsink**, and **Sunforge**. |
| **Next Mission** | The Helios Mission unlocks the [Yarn Mission]( {{< relref "space/Yarn_Mission.md" >}}). |

### 2. Helios Astrological Cycle

Helios is one of the ten cycles in the time system, identified by the glyph **⌒**. Each cycle lasts for five years.

Its effects are dependent on advanced Metaphysics research:

*   **With Numerology:** The cycle affects key space structures:
    *   **Sunlifter energy output is increased by +50%**.
    *   **Cryostation Storage is decreased by -10%**.
*   **With Numeromancy (Festival Bonus):** Holding a festival during the Helios cycle provides potent religious and luxury resource multipliers:
    *   **Faith income is multiplied by x2**.
    *   **Unicorn income is multiplied by x1.25**.

### 3. Challenge Goal

Helios is also the final destination required to complete the **Winter Has Come** challenge. This challenge imposes the restriction of an endless winter season throughout the run.
