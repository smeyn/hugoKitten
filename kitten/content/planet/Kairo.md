[Kairo]( {{< relref "planet/Kairo.md" >}}) ($\text{℣}$) refers to a deep space destination reachable via a mission and a recurring astrological cycle that significantly impacts late-game production, particularly starcharts.

### 1. Kairo Space Mission and Structures

The Kairo Mission is unlocked in the later stages of space exploration, following the T-minus Mission.

| Detail | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prerequisite** | T-minus Mission |
| **Cost** | 5,000 Starchart, 20,000 Titanium, 300k Science, and 7,500 Kerosene |
| **Travel Time** | 5,000 game-days (2 hours, 46 minutes, 40 seconds in real-time) |
| **Unlocks** | Kairo Planet, Rorschach Mission |

**Space Beacon Building**

Successfully completing the Kairo Mission unlocks the **Space Beacon** structure.

*   **Cost:** 25k Starchart, 50 Antimatter, 25k Alloy, and 7,500 Kerosene.
*   **Effects:** Provides a significant **+25K maximum Science** and generates **0.125 Starchart per second**.
*   The Space Beacon can be further upgraded by technology related to Relic Station, Black Nexus, and Hashes.

### 2. Kairo Astrological Cycle

Kairo is one of the ten planetary cycles in the game's time system, lasting five years, and is symbolised by the glyph $\text{℣}$. Its effects are primarily related to space production and science structures.

*   **Effects with Numerology:** When the **Numerology** upgrade is researched, the Kairo cycle generally imposes penalties on certain structures but provides a massive boost to Space Beacons:
    *   **Space Beacon starchart production** is boosted by **+400%**.
    *   Space Elevator transfer production bonus (oil only) is decreased by $-50\%$.
    *   Satellite starchart production, Satellite observatory’s science bonus, and Space Station science bonus are all decreased by $-25\%$.
*   **Festival Effect with Numeromancy:** If the [Numeromancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/numeromancy.md" >}}) upgrade is researched, holding a festival during the Kairo cycle provides a powerful **$\times 5$ multiplier to Starchart income**.
