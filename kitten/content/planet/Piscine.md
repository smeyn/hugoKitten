[Piscine]( {{< relref "planet/Piscine.md" >}}) ($\text{⎈}$) refers to a significant destination in the late mid-game space race, resulting in infrastructure critical for advancing scientific research and generating Starcharts. It is also one of the astronomical cycles in the game's time system.

### 1. Piscine Space Mission

The Piscine mission targets a gigantic aquatic planet characterised by an acid body and a methane atmosphere.

| Detail | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prerequisite** | Unlocked after successfully completing the [Moon Mission]( {{< relref "space/Moon_Mission.md" >}}). |
| **Cost** | Requires **1500 Starchart**, **9000 Titanium**, **200k Science**, and **250 Kerosene**. |
| **Travel Time** | 256 game-days (8 minutes, 32 seconds in real-time). |
| **Unlocks** | Unlocks the **Piscine Planet**, the **Research Vessel** building, and the [T-minus Mission]( {{< relref "space/T-minus_Mission.md" >}}). |

The Pisces Mission is a major investment point, requiring 1500 Starcharts to bypass the starchart bottleneck needed for continued space progression.

### 2. Research Vessel Building

The successful mission unlocks the **Research Vessel** building, which is crucial for maximizing scientific progress:

*   **Science Storage:** Each Research Vessel provides a substantial increase of **+10,000 maximum Science**.
*   **Starchart Production:** They are highly efficient, generating **0.05 Starchart per second**. Research Vessels are considered the most efficient way to acquire Starcharts.

### 3. Piscine Astrological Cycle

Piscine ($\text{⎈}$) is one of the ten planetary cycles in the time system, each lasting five years.

*   **Numerology Effect:** With the **Numerology** upgrade, the Piscine cycle offers contrasting effects on space production:
    *   **Research Vessel starchart production** is boosted by **+50%**.
    *   **Hydroponics Catnip Production** is decreased by **-50%**.
*   **Festival Effect (Numeromancy):** If the [Numeromancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/numeromancy.md" >}}) upgrade is researched, holding a festival during the Piscine cycle grants a powerful $\times 2$ multiplier to **Science income**.

***
The Piscine Mission unlocks Research Vessels, which are essential for boosting science maximums and generating Starcharts efficiently, setting the stage for the next deep space ventures like the T-minus Mission. This allows you to convert high-cost materials into a sustained, high-volume flow of Starcharts needed for future space exploration.
