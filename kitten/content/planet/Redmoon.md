[Redmoon]( {{< relref "planet/Redmoon.md" >}}) ($\text{⍜}$) is both a key destination in the space exploration phase and a recurring astronomical cycle in *Kittens Game*, offering significant advantages for late-game production, particularly of Unobtainium (UO).

### 1. Redmoon as a Planetary Mission

Redmoon is a planet satellite targeted during the mid-to-late game space race:

*   **Mission Unlock:** The [Moon Mission]( {{< relref "space/Moon_Mission.md" >}}) is unlocked after the Orbital Launch and requires 500 Starchart, 5000 Titanium, 125,000 Science, and 45,000 Oil to launch.
*   **Travel Time:** The journey to Redmoon takes 30 game-days, equivalent to 1 minute in real-time.
*   **Unlocks:** A successful mission unlocks the [Lunar Outpost]( {{< relref "planet/lunar_outpost.md" >}}) and the **Moon Base** structures, as well as the subsequent [Dune Mission]( {{< relref "space/Dune_Mission.md" >}}) and [Piscine Mission]( {{< relref "space/Piscine_Mission.md" >}}).

### 2. Buildings on Redmoon

The mission allows for the establishment of two critical structures on Redmoon:

*   [Lunar Outpost:]( {{< relref "planet/lunar_outpost.md" >}}) This nuclear-powered mining outpost is crucial for the Unobtainium economy. It consumes Uranium (at a rate of 1.75/sec) and produces **Unobtainium** (at 0.035/sec).
*   **Moon Base:** This base provides large storage increases for core resources, notably providing **+45,000 maximum Catnip** and **+150 maximum Unobtainium** storage.

### 3. Redmoon Astrological Cycle

Redmoon ($\text{⍜}$) is one of the ten astronomical cycles in the game's time system, with each cycle lasting five years. Its effects are highly advantageous for players who have researched advanced Metaphysics:

*   **With Numerology:** When the Numerology upgrade is researched, the Redmoon cycle affects specific space production:
    *   **Lunar Outpost unobtainium output** is increased by **+20%**.
    *   **Entanglement Station gigaflops consumption** is decreased by **-50%**.
*   **Festival Effect (With Numeromancy):** If the Numeromancy upgrade is researched, holding a festival during the Redmoon cycle grants a potent **$\times 2$ multiplier to Unobtainium income**.

### Strategic Importance in Endgame

The Redmoon cycle is strategically crucial in the endgame, particularly for advancing the Unobtainium (UO) economy:

*   **UO Production:** Since Unobtainium is a critical bottleneck resource refined from Uranium by the Lunar Outpost, the **Redmoon cycle's +20% boost to Lunar Outpost output** (with Numerology) is highly leveraged.
*   **Chrono-Optimization:** The Redmoon cycle is part of the Chrono Engine strategy. Using the Chronoforge to shatter Time Crystals (TCs) allows players to skip less profitable periods and arrive at the highly advantageous **Redmoon cycle**, which provides an instantaneous **$2.5\times$ boost to UO production** when combined with active Festivals and the Numeromancy upgrade. This strategy converts stored temporal capital (TCs) into a leveraged spike in high-value resource production.
*   **Unobtainium Production Formula:** If you are always in the Redmoon cycle, the formula for UO production gains an extra factor of $2.4 \times (1 + 0.01 \times \# \text{Breweries})$ when Numeromancy is researched. Therefore, spending time inside a **Redmoon cycle** is key for maximising unobtainium production.
