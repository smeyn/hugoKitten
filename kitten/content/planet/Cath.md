[Cath]( {{< relref "planet/Cath.md" >}}) ($\text{⌾}$) refers to two distinct concepts within *Kittens Game*: the name of the solar system where the game takes place, and a specific five-year astrological cycle.

### 1. The Cath Solar System

Cath is the name of the solar system in which the star [Helios]( {{< relref "planet/Helios.md" >}}) resides, which is a G2V spectral type star at the system's centre. The core resources of the game, such as unobtainium, are produced on planets or satellites within the Cath solar system.

### 2. The Cath Astrological Cycle

Cath is one of the ten planetary cycles in the time system, with each cycle lasting five years. It is identified by the glyph $\text{⌾}$. The effects of this cycle are only triggered once the **Numerology** upgrade has been researched.

**Effects with Numerology:**

When the Cath cycle is active, it provides several bonuses and a specific penalty related to space structures:

*   **Space Elevator transfer production bonus (for oil only):** Increased by $+100\%$. The Space Elevator structure also has its conversion production (resources produced by Smelters, Calciners, and Accelerators) on Cath boosted by a bonus of $0.4\%$ per leader rank per uncapped population buildings.
*   **Satellite starchart production:** Increased by $+100\%$.
*   **Satellite observatory’s science bonus:** Increased by $+100\%$.
*   **Space Station science bonus:** Increased by $+50\%$.
*   **Space Beacon starchart production:** Decreased by $-50\%$.

**Festival Effect with Numeromancy:**

If the advanced [Numeromancy]( {{< relref "metaphysics/numeromancy.md" >}}) upgrade is researched, holding a festival during the Cath cycle grants a significant $\times 2$ multiplier to **Catpower income**.
