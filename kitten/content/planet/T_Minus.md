[T-minus]( {{< relref "planet/T_Minus.md" >}}) (⍝) refers to both a significant deep space mission destination and a recurring astronomical cycle in *Kittens Game*.

### 1. T-Minus Space Mission and Structures

The T-minus Mission targets **Terminus**, a supermassive ice giant at the far end of the Helios solar system.

| Detail | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prerequisite** | The T-minus Mission is unlocked after the [Piscine Mission]( {{< relref "space/Piscine_Mission.md" >}}). |
| **Cost** | 2,500 Starchart, 12,000 Titanium, 225,000 Science, and 750 Kerosene. |
| **Travel Time** | 2,500 game-days (1 hour, 23 minutes, 20 seconds in real-time). |
| **Unlocks** | Successful completion unlocks the **T-Minus Planet**, the [Helios Mission]( {{< relref "space/Helios_Mission.md" >}}), the [Kairo Mission]( {{< relref "space/Kairo_Mission.md" >}}), and the **Cryostation** building. |

**Cryostation Building:**
The Cryostation, unlocked by this mission, is a vast storage facility complex that provides significant capacity increases for wood, minerals, iron, coal, uranium, titanium, oil, and unobtainium. Critically, each Cryostation provides **$+750$ maximum Unobtainium** (UO) storage. UO capacity, specifically from Cryostations and Moon Bases, defines the deep endgame progression toward positive chrono-resets.

### 2. T-Minus Astrological Cycle

T-minus ($\text{⍝}$) is one of the ten planetary cycles in the game's time system, lasting five years.

*   **With Numerology:** When the **Numerology** upgrade is researched, the T-minus cycle affects space structures:
    *   [Sunlifter]( {{< relref "space/sunlifter.md" >}}) energy output is decreased by **$-50\%$**.
    *   **Cryostation Storage** is increased by **$+20\%$**.
*   **Festival Effect with Numeromancy:** Holding a festival during the T-minus cycle grants a $\times 2$ multiplier to **Oil income**.

The temporary $+20\%$ boost to Cryostation storage during the T-minus cycle is significant because Cryostations are one of only two buildings that provide the maximum Unobtainium storage necessary for the late game.
