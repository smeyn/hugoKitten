**Centaurus** refers to a significant, late-game deep space mission destination—a warm, faraway star system—and the mission required to reach it in *Kittens Game*.

### 1. Centaurus Space Mission Details

The Centaurus Mission is a costly undertaking in the latter stages of space exploration:

*   **Prerequisite:** The mission is unlocked after completing the **Rorschach Mission**.
*   **Cost:** Researching and launching the Centaurus Mission requires vast amounts of late-game resources: **100,000 Starchart**, **40,000 Titanium**, **400,000 Science**, **50,000 Kerosene**, and **50,000 Thorium**.
*   **Travel Time:** The base travel time is **120,000 game-days**, which equates to 2 days, 18 hours, and 40 minutes in real-time.

### 2. Infrastructure and Challenge Unlock

A successful mission unlocks the Centaurus System and associated buildings:

*   **Building Unlocked (Tectonic):** The mission enables the construction of the **Tectonic** structure, provided the player has researched [Terraformation]( {{< relref "techs/Terraformation.md" >}}). Tectonic is a highly expensive energy production building, costing 600,000 Science, 500 Antimatter, and 75,000 Thorium, and producing **25 Energy**.
*   **Tectonic Upgrade:** The effectiveness of the Tectonic structure can be further improved by the **Molten Core** upgrade (unlocked by [Exophysics]( {{< relref "techs/Exophysics.md" >}})), which provides a +5% boost to Tectonic Energy Production per level.
*   **Challenge Requirement:** Completion of the **Centaurus Mission** is the specific unlock requirement for the [Energy]( {{< relref "resource/energy.md" >}}) challenge,. The Energy challenge imposes a doubled energy consumption rate on the player's village,.
