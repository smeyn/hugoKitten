[Yarn]( {{< relref "planet/Yarn.md" >}}) is a key deep space destination in *Kittens Game*, leading to new structures that boost population, catnip production, and scientific progression. It is identified by the symbol $\text{⍧}$ in the game's astrological time system.

Here is a detailed overview of the Yarn Mission, its costs, and the resulting infrastructure:

### Yarn Space Mission

The Yarn Mission targets a Class M planet described as having a high moderate climate, seas, and an oxygen atmosphere.

| Detail | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prerequisite** | The Yarn Mission is unlocked after the Helios Mission. |
| **Cost** | 7,500 Starchart, 35,000 Titanium, 350,000 Science, and 12,000 Kerosene. |
| **Travel Time** | 3,800 game-days (2 hours, 6 minutes, 40 seconds in real-time). |
| **Unlocks** | Successful completion unlocks the **Yarn Planet** and the next step in deep space exploration, the [Umbra Mission]( {{< relref "space/Umbra_Mission.md" >}}). |

### Infrastructure Unlocked on Yarn Planet

Completing the mission allows for the construction of two crucial buildings, provided the necessary technologies have been researched:

1.  **Terraforming Station:** This structure requires the [Terraformation]( {{< relref "techs/Terraformation.md" >}}) research.
    *   **Cost:** 25 Antimatter, 5,000 Uranium, and 5,000 Kerosene.
    *   **Effect:** Increases maximum kitten population by **+1**.
    *   Terraforming Yarn is noted as a necessary action for maximizing housing during deep endgame paragon farming runs.

2.  [Hydroponics:]( {{< relref "techs/Hydroponics.md" >}}) This highly efficient agricultural structure requires the [Hydroponics]( {{< relref "techs/Hydroponics.md" >}}) technology.
    *   **Cost:** 1 Unobtainium and 500 Kerosene.
    *   **Effects:** Hydroponics provides a **+2.5%** increase to Catnip Production and increases maximum Catnip Storage capacity by **+10%**. It also boosts the kitten bonus from the Terraforming Station by $+1.0\%$.

### Yarn Astrological Cycle

Yarn ($\text{⍧}$) is one of the ten astronomical cycles in the game, each lasting five years. The cycle has specific effects depending on advanced research:

*   **With Numerology:** The cycle significantly boosts **Hydroponics Catnip Production** by **+100%**. However, it imposes a penalty on **Research Vessel starchart production**, decreasing it by $-50\%$.
*   **With Numeromancy:** If a festival is held during the Yarn cycle, it provides a powerful $\times 2$ multiplier to **Culture income**.
