The [Furthest Ring]( {{< relref "planet/Furthest_Ring.md" >}}) is a late-game deep space mission destination, metaphorically described as **"The end of the universe"**.

### Mission Details and Cost

The Furthest Ring mission requires extremely high quantities of resources:

*   **Cost:** 500,000 Starchart, 1.25 million Science, 75,000 Kerosene, and 75,000 Thorium.
*   **Base Travel Time:** The base travel time for the mission is massive, calculated at 725,200,000 game-days.

### Travel Time Reduction

This extensive travel time can be significantly reduced through drive upgrades:

*   If you have researched both the [Antimatter Drive]( {{< relref "upgrade/Antimatter_Drive.md" >}}) and the [Thorium Drive]( {{< relref "upgrade/Thorium_Drive.md" >}}), the mission travel time is divided by 75.
*   With both drive upgrades, the travel time is reduced to approximately 223 days, 19 hours, 51 minutes, and 7 seconds in real-time.

### Status

Currently, the mission's unlock is listed as "(TBD)". As of one source's reported version (1.4.6.2.b), **no structures can be built in the Furthest Ring**. However, as of a later version (1.4.8.5), players who are logged in will see a text-based interface when they reach the Furthest Ring.
