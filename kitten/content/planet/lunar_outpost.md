A [Lunar Outpost]( {{< relref "lunar_outpost.md" >}}) is a space structure essential for late-game progression, specifically for refining uranium into unobtainium [1].

Here is a comprehensive overview of the Lunar Outpost based on the sources:

### Primary Function and Resources

The Lunar Outpost serves a single, critical purpose:
*   It **refines uranium into unobtainium** [1]. Unobtainium is a special resource required to unlock [Metaphysics]( {{< relref "metaphysics.md" >}}) [2] and to purchase high-tier buildings and upgrades, including [Unobtainium Huts]( {{< relref "unobtainium_huts.md" >}}) [3].
*   **Consumption Rate:** The Lunar Outpost consumes uranium at a rate of **1.75 per second** [4].
*   **Production Rate:** It produces unobtainium at a rate of **0.035 per second** [4]. This means, at full speed, it can produce 5 unobtainium in 142.8 seconds (about 2.3 minutes) [4].

### Acquisition and Prerequisites

The Lunar Outpost is unlocked and built through the Space tab [5]:
*   **Prerequisite:** You must first research the [Rocketry]( {{< relref "rocketry.md" >}}) science to enable the Space tab and space missions [5, 6].
*   **Mission Requirement:** The Lunar Outpost itself is unlocked by completing the [Moon Mission]( {{< relref "moon_mission.md" >}}) [4].
*   **Starchart Cost:** To complete the Lunar Outpost mission, you need **650 Starcharts** [7]. The total starcharts needed to reach the Lunar Outpost, starting from the [Orbital Launch]( {{< relref "orbital_launch.md" >}}) (250) and [Moon Mission]( {{< relref "moon_mission.md" >}}) (500), is **1,400 Starcharts** [7].
*   **Other Costs:** The Moon Mission itself also requires **45K oil** [8].

### Production Efficiency and Optimization

The Lunar Outpost's production of unobtainium is noted for its inefficiency relative to its resource consumption, which heavily bottlenecks early unobtainium production:

*   **Production Slowdown:** If your main source of uranium is a single [Accelerator]( {{< relref "accelerator.md" >}}) (which produces $0.0125$ uranium per second), the Lunar Outpost will run **140 times slower** than its maximum speed [9]. This means it could take 5.3 hours to produce 5 unobtainium, rather than 2.3 minutes [4, 9].
*   **Trade Solution:** Production can be sped up by trading with [Dragons]( {{< relref "trade/Dragons.md" >}}) for uranium [9].
*   **Redshift Advantage (Offline):** The source notes that the "Redshift" mechanic, which prevents resources from being deliberately reduced during offline progression, effectively allows Lunar Outposts to run **as if you have infinite uranium** while offline. This **significantly speeds up** unobtainium gain during offline progress because the outpost runs at full speed [10].
*   **Upgrades:** The [Microwarp Reactors]( {{< relref "microwarp_reactors.md" >}}) Workshop upgrade, unlocked by **Exometallurgy**, makes unobtainium production **75% more effective** [11].

### Related Space Structures

The Lunar Outpost is key to later resource storage and production:

*   **Moon Base:** Once you produce 50 unobtainium using the Lunar Outpost, you can build a **Moon Base** [12]. The Moon Base then increases your overall **Unobtainium storage capacity** [12, 13].
*   **Uranium Consumption:** Lunar Outposts initially consume **10 Wt of Energy**, although this consumption is reduced by [Antimatter Bases]( {{< relref "antimatter_bases.md" >}}) [14].

In short, the Lunar Outpost is the specialized factory on the moon that converts titanium-derived uranium into the scarce, late-game resource unobtainium, paving the way for further progression into space and metaphysics [1, 4].
