The [Sun Altar]( {{< relref "sun_altar.md" >}}) is a crucial religious upgrade available in *Kittens Game*, found under the **Order of the Sun** within the Religion tab.

Here is a breakdown of its effects, costs, and requirements:

### Function and Effects

The Sun Altar provides dual benefits by enhancing both resource capacity (Faith) and kitten morale (Happiness):

1.  **Faith Storage Increase**: The upgrade increases [Temple]( {{< relref "temple.md" >}}) maximum faith storage by **+50**.
    *   This bonus stacks, as each additional level of Sun Altar purchased using Transcendence increases this storage bonus by an **additional +50**.
2.  **Happiness Contribution**: The Sun Altar contributes to your civilization's overall [Happiness]( {{< relref "happiness.md" >}}) by increasing the happiness provided by Temples by **+0.5%**.
    *   This happiness bonus also scales with Transcendence, increasing by an additional **+0.1%** for each additional level purchased.

The sources also mention that the Sun Altar contributes to overall Happiness, highlighting that Religious upgrades *do* affect things outside the Religion tab.

### Requirements and Cost

To purchase the Sun Altar, you must have progressed sufficiently within the religious system:

*   **Prerequisite:** The upgrade requires you to have accumulated **750 Worship**. Worship is the resource gained by converting Faith via the "Praise the sun!" action.
*   **Cost:** The Sun Altar costs **500 Faith** and **250 Gold**.

### Context within Religious Progression

The Sun Altar is one of several upgrades available once you accumulate Worship, following earlier upgrades like Scholasticism (300 Worship) and Golden Spire (500 Worship). These upgrades are essential for expanding the role and efficiency of Temples, which are unlocked after researching Theology. Increasing faith storage is particularly important for later-game progression, as reaching high faith caps (100K Faith limit) is necessary to unlock **Apocrypha** and the related Epiphany mechanics.
