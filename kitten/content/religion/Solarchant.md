[Solar Chant]( {{< relref "religion/solar_chant.md" >}}) is a fundamental religious upgrade found within the **Order of the Sun** section of the Religion tab. It serves as a primary driver for scaling your colony's religious economy by directly increasing the rate at which [Faith]( {{< relref "resource/faith.md" >}}) is generated.

### **Cost and Requirements**
*   **Initial Cost:** 100 Faith.
*   **Prerequisite:** You must have accumulated at least **150 Worship** (formerly known as "praised faith") to unlock the option to purchase it.
*   **Price Ratio:** It has a **price ratio of 2.5**, meaning that if you unlock the ability to purchase multiple levels, each subsequent tier will cost 2.5 times more than the last.

### **Core Effects and Stacking**
*   **Base Bonus:** Upon the first purchase, Solar Chant provides a permanent **10% boost** to your overall faith generation rate.
*   **Transcendence Scaling:** Once you unlock the [Transcendence]( {{< relref "religion/Transcendence.md" >}}) upgrade (which requires 125,000 Worship, 7,500 Faith, and 7,500 Gold), Solar Chant becomes a **tiered upgrade**. 
*   **Incremental Growth:** For every additional level of Solar Chant purchased using Transcendence, the faith production bonus increases by an **additional +10%**.

### **Strategic Utility**
*   **Late-Game "Priest Strategy":** As players enter the late game and find themselves waiting for slow-moving resources like Unobtainium or Eludium, a common strategy is to reassign the majority of the kitten workforce to the **Priest job**. Solar Chant is critical here, as multiple levels of the upgrade significantly amplify the output of these priests.
*   **Faith Reset Loops:** High levels of Solar Chant facilitate a **positive feedback loop**. By dramatically increasing faith production, players can more rapidly rebuild their [Solar Revolution]( {{< relref "religion/Solar_Revolution.md" >}}) production bonus (which caps at 1000%) after performing a faith reset or "Adoring the Galaxy". 
*   **Transcendence Progression:** Accelerating faith production via Solar Chant is essential for reaching the extremely high epiphany requirements of later **Transcendence Tiers**, such as Tier 15, which requires approximately 3.04 million percent epiphany.
