The **Stained Glass** upgrade is a religious upgrade within *Kittens Game*, part of the **Order of the Sun**.

Here is a detailed explanation of its function, costs, and requirements:

### Function and Effects

The primary function of Stained Glass is to enhance the cultural output of your Temples.

*   **Culture Production Increase:** Stained Glass increases the amount of **culture per tick** generated by Temples by **+0.05**.
*   **Scaling:** This bonus is increased by an **additional +0.05** for each subsequent level of Stained Glass purchased using Transcendence.

### Requirements and Cost

Stained Glass becomes available for purchase relatively early in the religious progression:

*   **Prerequisite:** You must have accumulated **750 Worship**. Worship is the resource converted from Faith using the "Praise the sun!" action.
*   **Cost:** The upgrade requires **500 Faith** and **250 Gold**.

### Context

Stained Glass is unlocked at the same Worship threshold (750) as the **Sun Altar** upgrade. Both of these upgrades enhance the functionality of Temples.

Since Temples are one of the buildings that generate Culture (along with Amphitheatres and Chapels), Stained Glass helps advance your culture production. Culture is a vital special resource used to craft **Manuscripts** from Parchment, which are required for researching advanced technologies like **Theology** and **Astronomy**.
