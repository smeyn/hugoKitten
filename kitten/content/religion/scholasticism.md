[Scholasticism]( {{< relref "scholasticism.md" >}}) is a religious upgrade available within the *Kittens Game*, found under the **Order of the Sun** in the Religion tab.

This upgrade is crucial because, like other religious upgrades, it affects functionality outside of the Religion system.

### Prerequisites and Cost

To purchase Scholasticism, you must meet the following requirements:

*   **Prerequisite:** You must have accumulated **300 Worship**. Worship is converted from Faith by using the "Praise the sun!" action.
*   **Cost:** The upgrade costs **250 Faith**.

### Effects and Function

The primary function of Scholasticism is to integrate your religious structures into your scientific development:

*   **Science Contribution:** Scholasticism allows **Temples to contribute to Science**.
*   **Maximum Science Bonus:** Specifically, it grants Temples an effect of **+500 maximum science**. This helps prevent the Science resource cap from becoming a bottleneck when researching advanced technologies.
*   **Scaling:** The maximum science bonus provided by Temples is further increased by **+100 for each additional level** of Scholasticism purchased using Transcendence.

The ability to increase your maximum science cap is highly beneficial, as achieving high science limits (like the 125K needed for Concrete Huts) often requires numerous Science buildings such as Libraries, Academies, and Observatories. Scholasticism provides a direct boost to this vital resource capacity through existing Temple infrastructure.
