[Epiphany]( {{< relref "religion/epiphany.md" >}}) is a core prestige resource in *Kittens Game*, converted from your accumulated **Worship** and retained across game resets to accelerate progress in subsequent runs.

### Function and Conversion

1.  **Conversion:** Epiphany is converted from **Worship** by performing the action **"Adore the Galaxy"**. This ability is unlocked after purchasing the **Apocrypha** religious upgrade, which requires 100,000 Worship, 5,000 Faith, and 5,000 Gold.
2.  **Primary Effect:** Epiphany drives a bonus that makes **future Praising** (converting Faith to Worship) significantly stronger. This bonus helps players quickly build up the [Solar Revolution]( {{< relref "religion/Solar_Revolution.md" >}}) production bonus after a reset.
3.  **Persistence:** Epiphany is a special resource that **carries over** upon game reset, providing permanent acceleration for future runs. If you do not manually convert your Worship to Epiphany before resetting, the Worship will convert automatically with a slight penalty.

### Role in Transcendence

Epiphany is the currency used to gain **Transcendence Tiers** (TT), which are permanent religious upgrades.

*   **Spending Epiphany:** The **Transcend** mechanism allows you to spend Epiphany to increase your Transcendence Tier.
*   **Multiplier:** Increasing the Transcendence Tier, in turn, increases the conversion multiplier when performing **"Adore the Galaxy"**.
*   **Strategic Reset:** To maximise the Epiphany bonus before resetting the game, the player should **always execute Transcendence BEFORE Apocrypha** (Adoring the Galaxy).

For reference, the minimum Epiphany needed to reach Transcendence Tier 15 is approximately **3.04 million per cent**. A high Epiphany bonus is necessary to rapidly reach high Solar Revolution bonuses and is particularly useful in challenge modes like Iron Will.

### Historical Naming

For historic reasons, Epiphany may sometimes be referred to in the sources or gameplay community as **Apocrypha bonus** or **Adoration**.
