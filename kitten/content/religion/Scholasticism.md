[Scholasticism]( {{< relref "religion/Scholasticism.md" >}}) is a religious upgrade within the **Order of the Sun** that repurposes your Temples to serve as scientific infrastructure. By investing in this upgrade, your colony can significantly increase its maximum science capacity through religious devotion.

### **Acquisition and Costs**
*   **Unlocking:** You must first research [Theology]( {{< relref "science/Theology.md" >}}) to access the upgrade in the Religion tab.
*   **Prerequisites:** Scholasticism only appears once you have accumulated a minimum of **300 Worship** (formerly known as "praised faith").
*   **Cost:** The initial level of the upgrade costs **250 Faith**.
*   **Price Scaling:** It features a **price ratio of 2.5**, meaning if you unlock the ability to purchase it multiple times, each subsequent level will cost 2.5 times more than the last.

### **Effects and Scaling**
*   **Base Storage Bonus:** Upon purchase, every Temple in your village provides a flat **+500 bonus to maximum science storage**.
*   **Transcendence Tiers:** If you have purchased the [Transcendence]( {{< relref "religion/Transcendence.md" >}}) upgrade, you can buy additional levels of Scholasticism. Each extra level increases the storage bonus by an additional **+100 max science per Temple**.

### **Strategic Utility**
Scholasticism is a critical upgrade for overcoming the "science ceiling" often encountered in the mid-game. The sources indicate that as scientific research costs escalate—for example, requiring thousands of units for [Physics]( {{< relref "techs/Physics.md" >}}) or [Chemistry]( {{< relref "techs/Chemistry.md" >}})—standard bonfire buildings like Libraries and Academies may not provide enough storage on their own. 

By allowing Temples to contribute to science storage, Scholasticism provides a space-efficient way to reach higher caps. This is particularly useful because Temples are already desirable for their production of culture and faith. In specialized strategies, such as **Iron Will** mode, religious bonuses like Scholasticism are even more vital for scientific advancement since population-based science generation is restricted.
