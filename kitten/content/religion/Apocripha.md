**Apocrypha** is a high-level religious technology and system in *Kittens Game* that is crucial for converting accumulated **Worship** into a permanent prestige resource called [Epiphany]( {{< relref "religion/epiphany.md" >}}), which is retained across game resets.

### 1. Unlocking and Cost

*   **Prerequisites:** Apocrypha is a religious upgrade that requires reaching a total of **100,000 Worship** to unlock.
*   **Cost:** Once unlocked, purchasing Apocrypha requires **5,000 Faith** and **5,000 Gold**.

### 2. Core Functionality: Converting Prestige Currency

Apocrypha unlocks the ability to **"Adore the Galaxy"**. This action converts **all accumulated Worship** into [Epiphany]( {{< relref "religion/epiphany.md" >}}) (a hidden resource formerly known as the "Apocrypha bonus").

*   **Epiphany Effect:** Epiphany drives a bonus that makes **future Praising** (converting Faith to Worship) significantly stronger. This bonus is displayed on the "Praise the Sun!" button.
*   **Reset Carry-over:** Epiphany is a critical resource because it **carries over** upon game reset.
*   **Worship Loss:** Although Apocrypha allows Worship to convert into Epiphany (with a slight penalty) upon a hard game reset, players are advised that it is **better to manually Adore the Galaxy** before resetting to maximise the benefit. If you forget to manually convert, you won't lose *much* of the Worship.

### 3. Relationship with Transcendence

Apocrypha is integral to the Transcendence system, which is essential for maximizing permanent gains:

*   **Transcendence Requirement:** Apocrypha is required to unlock [Transcendence]( {{< relref "religion/Transcendence.md" >}}) (which requires 125,000 Worship, 7,500 Faith, and 7,500 Gold).
*   **Staging the Reset:** To maximize the gain derived from Faith investment before a game reset, players must always execute [Transcendence]( {{< relref "religion/Transcendence.md" >}}) (spending Epiphany to increase Transcendence tiers) **before** performing **Apocrypha** (Adoring the Galaxy). This ensures that the Epiphany gain is maximized, as Transcendence tiers increase the conversion multiplier when Adoring the Galaxy.
*   **Boosting Solar Revolution:** The accumulation of a high Apocrypha bonus (Epiphany) is essential because it allows the player to quickly achieve a high [Solar Revolution]( {{< relref "religion/Solar_Revolution.md" >}}) production bonus in subsequent runs. The Apocrypha bonus is often referred to as the "Adore percentage" when determining if performing Transcendence is worth the temporary sacrifice.

### 4. Strategic Importance

Apocrypha is a major step in Phase 3 of the game (Religious and Energy Transition Epoch), as it defines how players convert ephemeral religious production into permanent prestige capital.

*   **Long-Term Farming:** Strategically, you will want to get your Faith and Gold caps high enough to start 'storing' it with Apocrypha. In late-game runs, achieving high Apocrypha bonuses (over 3 million percent is needed for Transcendence Tier 15) is necessary to unlock high-tier religious abilities that boost late-game production, such as Blazar.
*   **Iron Will Mode:** In the resource-constrained Iron Will mode, getting the Apocrypha bonus high prior to entering the mode is suggested, as the resulting high [Solar Revolution]( {{< relref "religion/Solar_Revolution.md" >}}) bonus (which uses Worship/Faith) is highly useful in Iron Will.
