[Templars]( {{< relref "religion/Templars.md" >}}) is a high-tier religious upgrade available under the **Order of the Sun** in the Religion tab. It specifically enhances the utility of [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}) by increasing the colony’s maximum **Catpower** capacity.

### **Acquisition and Costs**
To unlock the Templars upgrade, you must first research [Theology]( {{< relref "science/Theology.md" >}}) and accumulate a significant amount of religious capital.
*   **Prerequisites:** You must have at least **75,000 Worship** accumulated through "Praising the Sun".
*   **Cost:** The initial upgrade costs **3,500 Faith** and **3,000 Gold**.
*   **Price Ratio:** Like most religious upgrades, it has a price ratio of **2.5**, meaning subsequent levels (if unlocked via Transcendence) become significantly more expensive.

### **Effects and Scaling**
The primary function of Templars is to turn your Temples into storage facilities for Catpower.
*   **Base Effect:** Each Temple provides **+75 max catpower**.
*   **Transcendence Scaling:** If you have purchased [Transcendence]( {{< relref "religion/Transcendence.md" >}}), you can buy additional levels of the Templars upgrade. Each additional level increases the bonus by a further **+25 max catpower** per Temple.

### **Strategic Utility**
While it may seem like a minor bonus early on, Templars is a critical component for late-game industrial and trade optimization:
*   **Blueprint Farming:** In the endgame, players often rely on [Mints]( {{< relref "buildings/Mint.md" >}}) to generate the massive quantities of blueprints needed for high-tier structures. Because Mints scale their output based on your **maximum Catpower capacity**, the boost provided by Templars directly increases your blueprint production speed.
*   **Policy Synergies:** The [Liberalism]( {{< relref "Policy/Liberalism.md" >}}) policy is specifically noted for allowing players to acquire more levels of the Templars upgrade more easily, which in turn assists with **ivory generation** and international **trade**.
*   **Resource Management:** By significantly raising the Catpower cap, Templars allows you to store enough energy to fund massive space missions, such as **Orbital Launches** (which require 5,000 Catpower) or **Rorschach Missions** (which require 80,000 Catpower), without being limited by standard housing caps.
