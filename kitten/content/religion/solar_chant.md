[Solar Chant]( {{< relref "solar_chant.md" >}}) is an essential religious upgrade available in the *Kittens Game* under the **Order of the Sun**. It specifically targets and enhances your civilization's ability to generate the special resource, Faith.

Here is a detailed explanation of Solar Chant, its prerequisites, and its strategic function:

### Function and Effect

The primary purpose of Solar Chant is to increase your production of Faith.

*   **Base Effect:** Solar Chant improves your base **faith generation rate by 10%**.
*   **Scaling:** As you progress into the mid-to-late game, you can purchase **additional levels** of Solar Chant using Transcendence. Each additional level purchased increases this bonus by an **additional +10%**.

### Cost and Prerequisites

Solar Chant is one of the early-game religious upgrades you should aim for to boost your Faith economy.

*   **Prerequisite:** The upgrade only becomes available for purchase once you have accumulated **150 Worship**.
*   **Cost:** The initial cost of the upgrade is **100 Faith**.

### Strategic Importance

Purchasing multiple levels of Solar Chant is a critical late-game strategy, especially as Faith production is generally affected by production boosts like Paragon but remains inherently slow.

By boosting your Faith income via multiple levels of Solar Chant (achieved through Transcendence), you can more effectively engage in the "Praise the sun!" mechanic, which converts accumulated Faith into Worship.

This strategy is vital because maximizing faith generation allows you to quickly restore your **Solar Revolution bonus** (a global production boost derived from Worship) after you have "reset" your faith pool using the **Adore the galaxy** option (unlocked via Apocrypha). In the late game, many kittens are typically assigned as Priests to maximize Faith generation, making the boost provided by Solar Chant highly impactful.
