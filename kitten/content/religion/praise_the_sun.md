"Praise the sun!" is a core action within the Religion tab of *Kittens Game*, defining the process of converting the special resource Faith into the resource Worship.

### Function and Resource Conversion

The action is available once you have any amount of accumulated **Faith**. When you select the "Praise the sun!" option:

*   It converts **all accumulated Faith** into **Worship**.
*   The system operates under the **Order of the Sun**, which is unlocked once you build a **Temple** (unlocked after researching **Philosophy** and subsequently **Theology**).

Worship is the name given to what was previously referred to as "praised faith".

### Uses of Worship

The primary purpose of performing "Praise the sun!" is to accumulate **Worship**, which serves two main goals:

1.  **Unlocking Religious Upgrades:** Various religious upgrades can be purchased using Faith, but only once sufficient Worship has been accumulated to unlock them. Examples include:
    *   **Solar Chant** (requires 150 Worship).
    *   **Scholasticism** (requires 300 Worship).
    *   **Sun Altar** and **Stained Glass** (require 750 Worship).

2.  **Solar Revolution Production Bonus:** Once you reach 1000 Worship, you can purchase the **Solar Revolution** upgrade (costs 750 Faith and 500 Gold). This grants a **global production bonus** based on the amount of accumulated Worship. This bonus is initially capped at 1000%, with diminishing returns starting at 750%.

### Long-Term Progression (Epiphany)

Later in the game, the effectiveness of praising the sun is tied to the **Epiphany** mechanic:

*   After researching **Apocrypha** (which requires 100K Worship and 5000 Faith/5000 Gold), you unlock the ability to **"Adore the galaxy"**.
*   Adoring the galaxy sacrifices all accumulated Worship and converts it into the hidden resource **Epiphany** (formerly called the "Apocrypha bonus").
*   Epiphany drives a bonus that makes **future Praising** (i.e., converting Faith into Worship) stronger. This bonus is displayed on the "Praise" button.
*   A major strategy in later runs involves pushing the Apocrypha/Epiphany bonus high so that after a reset, you can quickly achieve the maximum Solar Revolution production bonus by converting stored Faith into Worship via Praising the Sun.
