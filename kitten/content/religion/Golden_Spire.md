[Golden Spire]( {{< relref "religion/Golden_Spire.md" >}}) is a religious upgrade within the **Order of the Sun** that significantly expands your colony's capacity to store faith by enhancing the effectiveness of your [Temples]( {{< relref "buildings/Temple.md" >}}).

### **Acquisition and Costs**
*   **Unlocking:** The upgrade becomes available in the Religion tab once you have accumulated at least **500 Worship** (formerly known as "praised faith").
*   **Cost:** The initial purchase requires **350 Faith and 150 Gold**. 
*   **Price Scaling:** It follows a **price ratio of 2.5**, meaning that if you unlock the ability to buy multiple levels, each subsequent tier will be significantly more expensive.

### **Effects and Multipliers**
*   **Base Bonus:** Upon the first purchase, Golden Spire provides a **+50% bonus to the maximum faith** provided by your Temples.
*   **Application:** Crucially, this 50% multiplier is **applied after other effects**, making it a powerful "final" multiplier for your faith cap.
*   **Transcendence Synergy:** Once you have unlocked [Transcendence]( {{< relref "religion/Transcendence.md" >}}), Golden Spire becomes a tiered upgrade. Each additional level purchased increases the Temple storage bonus by an **additional +10%**.

### **Strategic Importance**
As your religious progression moves toward the **prestige transition**, the Golden Spire is essential for overcoming storage bottlenecks. Late-game milestones require increasingly large faith caps; for example, unlocking [Transcendence]( {{< relref "religion/Transcendence.md" >}}) itself requires a **125k faith cap**. By boosting the storage potential of every Temple you own, the Golden Spire allows you to reach these high thresholds without needing to build an excessive number of physical structures. 

Furthermore, having a larger faith cap facilitates deeper "Praising the Sun" sessions, which in turn helps you reach the worship totals required to maintain a high [Solar Revolution]( {{< relref "religion/Solar_Revolution.md" >}}) production bonus or to generate the [Epiphany]( {{< relref "religion/epiphany.md" >}}) needed for high Transcendence tiers.
