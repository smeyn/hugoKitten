[Solar Revolution]( {{< relref "religion/Solar_Revolution.md" >}}) is a high-impact religious upgrade within the **Order of the Sun** that provides a permanent **global production bonus** to nearly all resources in the game. To unlock this multiplier, you must first research [Theology]( {{< relref "science/Theology.md" >}}), accumulate at least **1,000 Worship**, and spend **750 Faith and 500 Gold**. 

### **Mechanism and Scaling**
*   **Calculation:** The bonus is calculated based on your total accumulated worship using the formula: $(sqrt(1+8 * worship / 1000)-1)/2$.
*   **Initial Impact:** While it may only provide a modest boost of 4–5% shortly after it is unlocked, it eventually becomes a primary driver of colony growth.
*   **Production Speed:** At higher levels, it can increase production rates to **50x normal speeds**, making expensive buildings and housing far more affordable. 
*   **Science Boost:** In addition to physical resources, overall **science production** is directly enhanced by the Solar Revolution multiplier.

### **Caps and Diminishing Returns**
The production bonus is subject to **diminishing returns** starting at **750%** and is initially **hard-capped at 1,000%**. However, this cap can be extended through advanced late-game mechanics:
*   [Black Obelisks:]( {{< relref "transcendence/Black_Obelisk.md" >}}) These cryptotheology buildings improve the Solar Revolution bonus cap by **+5% per transcendence tier**.
*   **Atheism Challenge:** While this challenge disables the Solar Revolution bonus entirely during the run, completing it provides a permanent reward where the cap increases by **100 percentage points for every Transcendence tier** you possess. 
*   **Effectiveness Reward:** Successive completions of the Atheism challenge also increase the **effectiveness** of the bonus by 10% per run, multiplicative with Black Obelisks.

### **Strategic Utility and Management**
*   **Unicorn Era:** Solar Revolution is essential for late-game progression because it is one of the only multipliers that affects **unicorn production**.
*   **Managing Sacrifices:** Because the bonus is so powerful, it is generally considered suboptimal to sacrifice faith for **Apocrypha** or [Transcendence]( {{< relref "religion/Transcendence.md" >}}) mid-run if it will significantly lower your current production bonus. Strategic advice suggests only sacrificing once you can quickly rebuild the bonus to the 750–1,000% range.
*   **Apocrypha Synergy:** A high **Apocrypha (epiphany) bonus** is vital because it allows you to praise the sun more effectively, enabling you to regain your maximum Solar Revolution multiplier in seconds after a reset.
*   **Environmental Factors:** You should be aware that high levels of **pollution** can harm resource production by negatively affecting your Solar Revolution bonus. 
*   **Iron Will:** In specialized **Iron Will** runs, Solar Revolution is a critical tool for overcoming the lack of kitten-based labor; players are encouraged to build a high Apocrypha bonus in previous runs to facilitate rapid growth in this mode.
