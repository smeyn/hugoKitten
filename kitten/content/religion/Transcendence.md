[Transcendence]( {{< relref "religion/Transcendence.md" >}}) is a permanent religious progression system in the sources that allows players to stack tiered upgrades and boosts the efficiency of "Adoring the stars". It is unlocked in the religion tab for **7,500 Faith and 7,500 Gold** once you have reached a prerequisite of **125,000 Worship**.

### **Mechanics of Transcending**
Once the initial upgrade is purchased, a permanent "**Transcend**" button appears. This allows you to spend [Epiphany]( {{< relref "religion/epiphany.md" >}})—a hidden resource converted from Worship when you "Adore the Galaxy"—to increase your **Transcendence Tier**. 
*   **Carry Over:** Transcendence tiers are among the few things that **permanently carry over** through game resets.
*   **Tier Thresholds:** The cost in Epiphany increases exponentially; for example, Tier 1 requires ~1.97% Epiphany, while **Tier 15 requires ~3.04M%**.

### **Strategic Progression: BMF and TAP**
The sources provide two specific methods for managing Transcendence to avoid losing progress or production bonuses:

1.  **The BMF Reset Protocol:** To maximize prestige gains before a game reset, players should follow the **Backup, Metas, Faith (BMF)** order. Within the Faith step, you must **Transcend before you Adore the stars**. Because higher Transcendence tiers increase the conversion multiplier for Adoration, this order ensures you receive the maximum possible Epiphany for your next run.
2.  **The Mid-Run TAP Method:** If you wish to Transcend without resetting the entire game, the sources suggest the **TAP (Transcend, Adore, Praise)** procedure. A rule of thumb is to have at least **1.5 times the Epiphany threshold** listed for the next tier before doing this, otherwise, you may severely decrease your praising bonus and harm your current production.

### **Endgame Benefits and Unlocks**
Reaching higher Transcendence tiers is essential for late-game and "Phase 3" progression:
*   [Cryptotheology:]( {{< relref "techs/Cryptotheology.md" >}}) Tiers are required to unlock specific endgame buildings. For instance, [Black Obelisks]( {{< relref "transcendence/Black_Obelisk.md" >}}) require Tier 1, while [Blazars]( {{< relref "transcendence/Blazar.md" >}})—which are vital for time crystal and relic production—require **Tier 15**.
*   **Atheism Challenge:** Completing this challenge grants a permanent reward where the **Solar Revolution cap** increases by **100 percentage points for every Transcendence tier** you possess.
*   **Tiered Upgrades:** Each tier allows you to purchase additional levels of religious upgrades like [Solar Chant]( {{< relref "religion/solar_chant.md" >}}) (+10% faith generation), [Scholasticism]( {{< relref "religion/Scholasticism.md" >}}) (+ science), and [Sun Altar]( {{< relref "religion/Sun_Altar.md" >}}) (+ happiness/faith storage).
*   **Unicorn Tears Challenge:** In this mode, [Unicorn Tombs]( {{< relref "ziggurat/Unicorn_Tomb.md" >}}) increase your maximum faith specifically based on your Transcendence Tier.
