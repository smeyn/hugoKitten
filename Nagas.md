The [Nagas]( {{< relref "trade/Nagas.md" >}}) are a neutral trading partner (0% attitude) in *Kittens Game*, specializing in **Minerals** and mineral-based materials. They are crucial for accelerating your supply of building materials and advanced resources.

Here is a comprehensive overview of Nagas:

### Unlocking and Prerequisites

*   **Prerequisite:** Nagas are unlocked once you achieve a **1500 Culture** maximum. Achieving this culture maximum often requires a substantial culture grind.
*   **Trade Currency:** Before you can trade with Nagas (or any other civilization), you must first develop the [Gold Ore]( {{< relref "upgrade/Gold_Ore.md" >}}) upgrade in the Workshop, enabling you to create **Gold**, which is required for trade costs.

### Trade Details

The Nagas primarily trade minerals in exchange for Ivory:

| Action | Resource | Minimum Amount | Buy/Sell | Strategic Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Buy** | Ivory | 500 | Buy | Ivory is gained via Hunting. |
| **Sell** | Minerals | 1000 | Sell | Naga trade is a **huge step forward with respect to mineral production**. |

**Secondary Resources:** Nagas also sell higher-tier crafted materials once you build embassies:
*   **Slab** (5 units, 75% chance) at Embassy Level 5.
*   [Concrete]( {{< relref "craft/Concrete.md" >}}) (5 units, 25% chance) at Embassy Level 10.
*   [Megalith]( {{< relref "craft/Megalith.md" >}}) (1 unit, 10% chance) at Embassy Level 15.

### Strategic Trading

1.  **Seasonal Optimization:** The trade for Minerals is optimally performed during the **Spring** season, which provides a **+25% Amount Modifier**. It is specifically suggested to **trade with the Nagas only in spring**.
2.  **Trade Loop:** The minerals acquired from Nagas in exchange for Ivory can be immediately reinvested. These minerals can be put back into your [Smelters]( {{< relref "buildings/Smelter.md" >}}) to produce more **Gold**, which is required to cover trade costs and build other structures.
3.  **Blueprint Acquisition:** Like all trades, a successful trade with Nagas has a **10% chance of including one Blueprint** as an extra resource. This is a fixed rate unaffected by general trade bonuses.

### Related Policy/ and Upgrades (Naga Relations)

The **Naga Relations** foreign Policy/ become available after reaching Embassy Level 20 and researching the [Diplomacy]( {{< relref "Policy/Diplomacy.md" >}}) metaphysics upgrade.

*   **Naga Relations: Architects:** This policy increases the chance to get **blueprints from Nagas by 0.25%** per embassy, capping at **10% at 40 embassies**. Once the maximum bonus is reached, additional embassies improve the blueprint crafting ratio by +2% instead.
*   **Naga Relations: Masons:** This policy grants a **+2.5% Quarry slab crafting bonus**.
*   **Naga Relations: Cultists:** This policy causes [Ziggurat]( {{< relref "buildings/Ziggurat.md" >}}) to gain **10% of the bonuses** that the **Order of the Sun** grants to temples.
*   **Isolationism Path:** The policy choice [Isolationism]( {{< relref "Policy/Isolationism.md" >}}) over Diplomacy may be preferred for the **additional naga exchanges**.
